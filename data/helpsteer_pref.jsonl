{"prompt":"explain master slave replication nsql","chosen":"In the context of NoSQL databases, master-slave replication refers to a configuration where a single master node writes data, and one or more slave nodes read data from the master and replicate it to provide read scalability. The master node is responsible for accepting write requests and updating its own data, while the slave nodes are responsible for replicating the data from the master and serving read requests.\n\nIn this configuration, the master node is the only node that can make changes to the data, while the slave nodes can only read the data and replicate it. This ensures that the data is consistent across all nodes and that there is no data loss in case of a failure of a single node.\n\nMaster-slave replication in NoSQL databases can be implemented using various technologies, such as Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, and Apache HBase. In each of these databases, the master-slave replication configuration can be set up using specific configuration options and parameters.\n\nIt's worth noting that master-slave replication is not a failover solution, as the failure of the master node will result in the loss of data until the node is brought back online. Therefore, it's important to have a proper disaster recovery plan in place to ensure that data is protected in case of a failure.","rejected":"In SQL, master-slave replication is a technique used to create a copy of a database on a separate server. The master server is the primary server that contains the original data, while the slave server is the secondary server that contains a copy of the data. The master server sends updates to the slave server, which then applies them to its own database.\n\nHere's how master-slave replication works:\n\n1. The master server sends a stream of updates to the slave server, which includes information about changes made to the database on the master server.\n\n2. The slave server receives the updates and applies them to its own database, creating a copy of the master server's database.\n\n3. The slave server can also send updates back to the master server, which can be used to keep the two databases in sync. This is known as two-way replication.\n\n4. If the master server fails, the slave server can take over as the new master server, ensuring that the database remains available.\n\nMaster-slave replication can be used to increase the availability and scalability of a database, as well as to create a backup of the data in case of failure. However, it's important to note that master-slave replication can be complex to set up and maintain, and it may not be suitable for all types of databases.\n\nIn NoSQL, master-slave replication is similar to SQL in that it involves creating a copy of a database on a separate server. However, NoSQL databases are typically more flexible and scalable than SQL databases, and they may use different replication techniques.\n\nFor example, some NoSQL databases use a distributed architecture, where data is stored across multiple servers and replicated in real-time. This can provide high availability and fault tolerance, as well as increased performance.\n\nOther NoSQL databases may use a master-slave replication model similar to SQL, where a master server sends updates to one or more slave servers. However, NoSQL databases may also use other replication techniques, such as peer-to-peer replication or multi-master replication, depending on the specific needs of the application.\n\nOverall, master-slave replication is an important technique for creating a copy of a database on a separate server, increasing the availability and scalability of the database, and providing a backup in case of failure. While it can be complex to set up and maintain, it can be a valuable tool for ensuring the reliability and performance of a database."}

This ensures that the colors of the pralines are accurately represented in the images, making it easier to identify any anomalies.\n\nNext, we use foreground-background segmentation to identify the individual pralines in the image. Contour areas are then used as robust filters to remove any background noise or unwanted objects from the image.\n\nOnce the pralines have been segmented, we compute 17 hand-crafted features for each one. These features include measures of shape, size, color, and texture, which are then used to classify each praline into its respective category.\n\nTo train the machine learning model, we used a decision tree algorithm. The model was trained on a dataset of over 1,000 images of pralines, and achieved an accuracy of over 95% in identifying the correct category for each one.\n\nWith this system in place, our clients in the confectionery industry can now automate their quality control processes and ensure that each and every praline meets their high standards for appearance and consistency.\n\nIf you're interested in learning more about our machine vision solutions, please contact us today.

{"prompt":"Explain the different types of life insurance","chosen":"There are several types of life insurance policies available, each with its own unique features and benefits. Here are some of the most common types of life insurance:\n\nTerm Life Insurance: Term life insurance provides coverage for a specific period of time, such as 10, 20, or 30 years. If the policyholder dies during the term of the policy, the beneficiary will receive a death benefit. Term life insurance is generally the most affordable type of life insurance, but it does not build cash value.\n\nWhole Life Insurance: Whole life insurance provides lifelong coverage and also has a cash value component. The cash value grows tax-deferred and can be accessed through loans or withdrawals. Whole life insurance typically has higher premiums than term life insurance, but it can be a good option for those who want lifelong coverage and the potential for cash value growth.\n\nUniversal Life Insurance: Universal life insurance also provides lifelong coverage and has a cash value component, but the cash value grows at a variable rate based on market performance. Universal life insurance policies typically have more flexibility than whole life insurance policies, allowing policyholders to adjust their premiums and death benefits over time.\n\nVariable Life Insurance: Variable life insurance provides lifelong coverage and a cash value component, but the cash value is invested in stocks, bonds, or other securities. The cash value growth and death benefit are tied to the performance of the investments, so there is more risk but also more potential for reward.\n\nVariable Universal Life Insurance: Variable universal life insurance combines the features of variable life insurance and universal life insurance, giving policyholders more flexibility to adjust their premiums and death benefits while also investing their cash value in stocks, bonds, or other securities.\n\nIt's important to consider your individual needs and financial situation when choosing a life insurance policy. A financial advisor can help you determine which type of life insurance is best for you and recommend a policy that fits your budget and provides the coverage you need.","rejected":"Here are some of the common types of life insurance:\n\n1. Term life insurance: This is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for a specific period, usually 10-30 years.

Term life insurance is typically the most affordable option, as it has no cash value buildup.\n\n2. Whole life insurance: This is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for the policyholder's entire life. It offers a death benefit, as well as a cash value component that grows over time. The cash value can be used for things like retirement, college tuition, or other financial goals. Whole life insurance can be more expensive than term life insurance, but it provides lifelong coverage and has a cash value component.\n\n3. Universal life insurance: This is a type of life insurance that provides flexible coverage and allows the policyholder to adjust the death benefit and premium payments. Like whole life insurance, universal life insurance has a cash value component that grows over time. The cash value can be used for things like retirement, college tuition, or other financial goals. Universal life insurance also allows the policyholder to adjust the death benefit and premium payments to fit their changing needs.\n\n4. Variable life insurance: This is a type of life insurance that provides coverage for the policyholder's entire life. It offers a death benefit, as well as a cash value component that is invested in a portfolio of securities. The cash value can grow or decline based on the performance of the underlying investments. Variable life insurance can be more complex and expensive than other types of life insurance, but it offers the potential for higher returns.\n\n5. Final expense insurance: This is a type of life insurance that is designed to cover the costs associated with a funeral or other final expenses. It is typically smaller in size, with death benefits ranging from $5,000 to $50,000. Final expense insurance is often more affordable than other types of life insurance, and it can provide peace of mind for the policyholder's loved ones.\n\nThese are some of the main types of life insurance, and the best type of coverage will depend on an individual's specific needs and financial situation. It's important to work with a qualified life insurance agent to determine the best type of coverage for you."}

{"prompt":"\u2018Plea negotiation is widely used in the criminal justice system, yet seldom praised.\u2019 Evaluate the weaknesses \nof the use of plea negotiation in the criminal justice system","chosen":"Plea negotiation is a widely used procedure in the criminal justice system that allows defendants to plead guilty to a lesser charge in exchange for a reduced sentence. While plea negotiation can be a useful tool for both defendants and prosecutors, it has its weaknesses and limitations.\n\nOne of the main weaknesses of plea negotiation is that it can be coercive and unfair to defendants. In many cases, defendants may feel pressured to accept a plea deal, even if they are innocent or feel that they have a strong defense. This is because the alternative to accepting a plea deal may be a longer sentence or even a conviction on more serious charges.\n\nAnother weakness of plea negotiation is that it can lead to the conviction of innocent people. In some cases, defendants may feel that they have no choice but to accept a plea deal, even if they are innocent, in order to avoid a longer sentence or conviction on more serious charges. This can result in innocent people being convicted and sent to prison, which is a serious injustice.\n\nPlea negotiation can also be criticized for being inefficient and time-consuming. The process of negotiating a plea deal can take up a significant amount of time and resources, which could otherwise be spent on resolving the case through trial. This can lead to delays in the criminal justice system, which can be frustrating for victims and witnesses who may have to wait longer for justice to be served.\n\nAdditionally, plea negotiation can be seen as a form of \"plea-bargaining,\" which is when prosecutors offer reduced sentences in exchange for information or cooperation from defendants. This can be seen as a form of \"plea-bargaining,\" which is when prosecutors offer reduced sentences in exchange for information or cooperation from defendants. This can be seen as a form of coercion, as defendants may feel pressured to cooperate with prosecutors in order to receive a more favorable sentence.\n\nFurthermore, plea negotiation can lead to unequal treatment in the criminal justice system. Not all defendants may have the same access to resources and legal representation, which can result in some defendants receiving more favorable plea deals than others. This can lead to unequal treatment and a lack of fairness in the criminal justice system.\n\nIn conclusion, while plea negotiation can be a useful tool in the criminal justice system, it has its limitations and weaknesses. It can be coercive and unfair to defendants, lead to the conviction of innocent people, be inefficient and time-consuming, and result in unequal treatment in the criminal justice system. Therefore, it is important for the criminal justice system to carefully consider the use of plea negotiation and ensure that it is being used in a fair and equitable manner.","rejected":"Plea bargaining, which is the process by which the defendant pleads guilty to a lesser charge or to a greater charge in exchange for a reduced sentence, has several weaknesses that can be detrimental to the criminal justice system. Some of the weaknesses of plea bargaining are:\n\n1. Injustice: Plea bargaining can result in injustice as it allows the guilty to go free or receive a lighter sentence while the innocent are convicted. This is because the defendant may take a plea deal to avoid the risk of a longer sentence or a conviction on a more serious charge, even if they are not guilty.\n\n2. Lack of Transparency: Plea bargaining often takes place behind closed doors, which means that the public and the victims of the crime are not aware of the negotiations and the resulting plea deal. This lack of transparency can lead to a lack of confidence in the criminal justice system.\n\n3. Inequitable Treatment: Plea bargaining can result in inequitable treatment of defendants as those who cannot afford a good lawyer may take a plea deal to avoid a longer sentence, even if they are innocent. On the other hand, those who can afford a good lawyer may be able to negotiate a better plea deal.\n\n4. Overcrowding of Courts: Plea bargaining can lead to an overcrowded court system as the majority of criminal cases are resolved through plea bargaining, leaving fewer cases for trial. This can result in a backlog of cases and a delay in justice for the victims of crime.\n\n5. Reduced Punishment: Plea bargaining can result in reduced punishment for the guilty as they may plead guilty to a lesser charge or receive a reduced sentence in exchange for a guilty plea. This can result in a lack of deterrence and a reduction in the severity of punishment for criminal behavior.\n\nIn conclusion, plea bargaining has several weaknesses that can be detrimental to the criminal justice system. While plea bargaining can be a useful tool in resolving criminal cases, it is important to ensure that it is used fairly and transparently to ensure justice for all parties involved."}

Final Thoughts on Ensuring Political Power for the Greater Good\n\nExample:\n\nOne example of the use of political power for the greater good is the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. Led by figures such as Martin Luther King Jr., the movement used nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience to challenge the institution of segregation and secure equal rights for African Americans. The movement relied heavily on the power of rhetoric and symbolism to garner public support and pressure the government to act. Ultimately, the movement led to the passage of important legislation such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited discrimination based on race in a variety of areas, including employment, housing, and voting. This example illustrates how political power can be used to bring about positive change and promote justice and equality for all.","rejected":"The Political Power: A Philosophical Analysis\n\nI. Introduction\nThe concept of political power is a complex and multi-faceted one, which has been the subject of philosophical inquiry for centuries. At its most basic level, political power can be defined as the ability of one group or individual to influence the behavior of another group or individual in a political context. However, this simple definition fails to capture the full complexity of the issue, and it is important to examine the various ways in which political power can be understood and analyzed from a philosophical perspective.\n\nII. Defining the Topic\nOne of the key challenges in analyzing the concept of political power is that it can be understood in a variety of different ways. For example, some philosophers may focus on the ways in which political power is distributed within a society, while others may be more interested in the ways in which political power is exercised by individuals or groups. Additionally, some philosophers may be concerned with the ethical implications of political power, while others may be more interested in the practical implications of how political power is wielded.\n\nIII. Identifying the Tension\nAnother challenge in analyzing the concept of political power is that it can often give rise to tensions and contradictions. For example, on the one hand, political power can be seen as a necessary component of any functioning society, as it allows for the resolution of conflicts and the establishment of social order. On the other hand, political power can also be seen as a source of oppression and inequality, as it can be used by those in positions of power to maintain their own privileges and advantages.\n\nIV. Developing a Plan\nIn order to analyze the concept of political power in a meaningful way, it is important to develop a clear and structured plan. This plan should include a definition of the key terms and concepts that will be used in the analysis, as well as a clear statement of the research questions that will be addressed. Additionally, the plan should include a clear methodology for analyzing the data and drawing conclusions, as well as a timeline for completing the research.\n\nV. Subparts\nIn order to develop a comprehensive analysis of the concept of political power, it is useful to break the topic down into subparts. Some possible subparts might include:\n\nThe distribution of political power within a society\nThe exercise of political power by individuals or groups\nThe ethical implications of political power\nThe practical implications of political power\nThe relationship between political power and social inequality\nVI. Examples\nIn order to illustrate the various ways in which political power can be understood and analyzed, it can be useful to provide examples from real-world situations. For example, one might examine the ways in which political power is distributed within a particular country, or the ways in which political power is exercised by different interest groups. Additionally, one might examine the ways in which political power is used to maintain social inequality, or the ways in which political power is used to resolve conflicts and establish social order.\n\nVII. Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the concept of political power is a complex and multi-faceted one, which has been the subject of philosophical inquiry for centuries. In order to analyze the concept of political power in a meaningful way, it is important to develop a clear and structured plan, including subparts and examples. Additionally, it is important to be aware of the various tensions and contradictions that can arise when analyzing the concept of political power, and to approach the topic from a critical and reflective perspective."}

Sharing content can help you collaborate with others, get feedback, and reach a wider audience.\n\n2. Export: This function allows you to save the content you are working on in a format that can be used by other applications. For example, if you are working on a document in a word processing app, you can export it as a PDF file, which can be opened and viewed in other applications. Exporting content can help you share your work with others who may not have the same software as you, and it can also help you archive your work for future use.\n\nIn summary, the \"Share\" function allows you to share your content with others, while the \"Export\" function allows you to save your content in a format that can be used by other applications.

{"prompt":"what kind of bond is formed between 2 monomers of sugar to create a di- or poly-saccharide","chosen":"The bond formed between two monomers of sugar to create a di- or poly-saccharide is a covalent bond. A covalent bond is a type of chemical bond that is formed when two atoms share a pair of electrons to form a molecular bond. In the case of sugar, the monomers are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms, and the covalent bond is formed when the atoms share their electrons to create a stable molecule.\n\nThe specific type of bond formed between two sugar monomers depends on the type of sugar involved. For example, in the case of a disaccharide, such as sucrose (table sugar), the bond between the two sugar monomers is a glycosidic bond. A glycosidic bond is a type of covalent bond that is formed between the carbon atom of one sugar monomer and the oxygen atom of another sugar monomer. This bond is characterized by the sharing of a pair of electrons between the carbon and oxygen atoms, which results in the formation of a stable molecule.\n\nIn the case of a polysaccharide, such as starch or glycogen, the bond between the sugar monomers is also a covalent bond, but it is a different type of bond known as an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond. This type of bond is formed between the carbon atom of one sugar monomer and the oxygen atom of another sugar monomer, but in this case, the bond is formed along a chain of sugar monomers in a linear fashion. The result is a long chain of sugar molecules that are linked together through these covalent bonds, forming the larger molecule known as a polysaccharide.\n\nIn summary, the bond formed between two monomers of sugar to create a di- or poly-saccharide is a covalent bond, specifically a glycosidic bond in the case of a disaccharide or an alpha-1,4-glycosidic bond in the case of a polysaccharide. These bonds are formed through the sharing of electrons between the carbon and oxygen atoms of the sugar monomers, resulting in the formation of stable molecules that are essential for many biological processes in the body.","rejected":"The bond that forms between two monomers of sugar to create a di- or poly-saccharide is a covalent bond. Specifically, it is a glycosidic bond, which is formed between the hydrogen atom of the hydroxyl group of one sugar molecule and the oxygen atom of the other sugar molecule. This bond is formed when the two sugar molecules are brought into close proximity, usually through the action of an enzyme, and then undergo a series of chemical reactions to form the final product. The resulting bond is a stable and strong bond that is responsible for the structure and properties of the resulting di- or poly-saccharide."}

{"prompt":"Why are addition and multiplication commutative, but exponentiation is not?","chosen":"Addition and multiplication are commutative operations, which means that the order of the operands does not affect the result. This is because addition and multiplication are distributive over each other, which means that a + b = b + a and a * b = b * a.\n\nExponentiation, on the other hand, is not a commutative operation. This means that the order of the operand and the exponent does affect the result. For example, 2^3 is not equal to 3^2, because 2^3 is equal to 8, while 3^2 is equal to 9.\n\nThe reason for this is that exponentiation is an operation that involves repeated multiplication. When we write 2^3, we are saying that we want to take 2 and multiply it by itself three times. Similarly, when we write 3^2, we are saying that we want to take 3 and multiply it by itself two times. However, the order of the operand and the exponent matters in this case, because the result will be different depending on whether we take 2 and multiply it by itself three times, or whether we take 3 and multiply it by itself two times.","rejected":"In mathematics, the properties of addition and multiplication are such that the result does not depend on the order of the terms. For example, 5 + 3 = 8 and 3 + 5 = 8. This is called the commutative property of addition. Similarly, 5 x 3 = 15 and 3 x 5 = 15. This is called the commutative property of multiplication.\n\nHowever, the same cannot be said for exponentiation. The result of an exponentiation operation does depend on the order of the terms. For example, 5^3 = 125 and 3^5 = 243. This is called the non-commutative property of exponentiation.\n\nThe reason for this difference is that exponentiation is a repeated multiplication operation, and the order of the terms matters in multiplication. For example, (3 x 5)^2 = 25 and 3^2 x 5^2 = 25. The order of the terms matters in this case, and changing the order of the terms will result in a different answer.\n\nIn general, the commutative property holds for addition and multiplication, but not for exponentiation. This is a fundamental property of mathematics that is important to understand in order to perform calculations correctly and accurately."}

Here are some tips for working with a client who has a sensitive scalp:\n\n1. Perform a skin test: Before coloring the hair, perform a skin test to check for any allergic reactions. Apply a small amount of the hair dye to the client's skin and wait 48 hours to see if any irritation occurs.\n\n2. Use a gentle hair color: Choose a hair color that is free from harsh chemicals such as ammonia, which can irritate the scalp. Opt for a gentle, low-ammonia or no-ammonia hair color instead.\n\n3. Mix the hair color correctly: When mixing the hair color, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions and use the correct ratio of hair color to developer. Overmixing can cause the hair color to be too strong and irritate the scalp.\n\n4. Apply the hair color carefully: When applying the hair color, be gentle and avoid rubbing or scrubbing the scalp. Use a soft brush or sponge to apply the color evenly and avoid getting the color on the client's skin.\n\n5. Use a soothing scalp treatment: After the hair color has been applied, use a soothing scalp treatment to help calm any irritation. You can also add a few drops of lavender or tea tree oil to the scalp to help soothe and calm the skin.\n\n6. Avoid using hot water: When washing the hair after the coloring process, avoid using hot water as it can irritate the scalp. Use lukewarm water instead and be gentle when washing and drying the hair.\n\nRegarding the question of adding Sweet 'N Low to hair dye to keep the scalp from burning, it's not recommended to add any additives to hair dye as it may affect the color and the performance of the product. It's best to follow the manufacturer's instructions and take the steps mentioned above to minimize the risk of scalp irritation.","rejected":"As a hair colorist, my main priority is to ensure the safety and satisfaction of my customers. When it comes to customers with a sensitive scalp, it's important to take extra precautions to prevent any discomfort or irritation during the hair coloring process.\n\nOne way to prevent the scalp from burning during a hair color application is to add a sweetener to the dye mixture. Sweet N Low is a common sweetener used in hair dye to reduce the burning sensation on the scalp.\n\nTo determine the appropriate amount of Sweet N Low to add to the hair dye, it's important to consider the size of the dye mixture and the sensitivity of the customer's scalp. As a general guideline, I would recommend adding one to two packets of Sweet N Low to a full hair dye mixture.\n\nBefore applying the hair dye to the customer's scalp, it's important to do a patch test to ensure that the customer is not allergic to the dye mixture. I would apply a small amount of the dye mixture to a discreet area of the scalp and leave it on for a few minutes to see if there is any reaction.\n\nOnce the patch test is complete and the customer is cleared to proceed with the hair coloring process, I would apply the dye mixture to the scalp, being careful to avoid any areas that are irritated or broken. I would also avoid applying the dye too close to the hairline or the ears, as these areas are often more sensitive.\n\nDuring the processing time, I would keep a close eye on the customer's scalp to ensure that there is no burning or irritation. If the customer experiences any discomfort, I would immediately rinse the dye from the scalp and consider alternative solutions to achieve the desired hair color.\n\nIn conclusion, adding Sweet N Low to hair dye can help prevent the scalp from burning during the coloring process, but it's important to take precautions and consider the sensitivity of the customer's scalp. As a hair colorist, it's my responsibility to ensure the safety and satisfaction of my customers, and I would take a step-by-step approach to ensure that the hair coloring process is as comfortable and successful as possible."}

{"prompt":"List all possible Neural Network Architectures with descriptions","chosen":"There are many different neural network architectures, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are some common architectures:\n\n1. Feedforward Neural Network: This is a simple neural network that consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The neurons in each layer are fully connected to the next layer, but there are no connections between neurons in the same layer. The network processes the input data in a forward direction, from the input layer to the output layer.\n\n2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): This architecture is commonly used for image and video processing. It consists of a series of convolutional layers, each of which applies a set of filters to the input data to extract features. The features are then passed through a pooling layer to reduce their dimensionality, and finally, the resulting features are fed into a fully connected layer for classification.\n\n3. Recurrent Neural Network (RNN): This architecture is used for sequential data, such as text or speech. It processes the input data in a sequential manner, with each neuron in the network receiving input not only from the previous layer but also from the previous time step. RNNs are well-suited for tasks such as language modeling, machine translation, and speech recognition.\n\n4. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): This is a type of RNN that is designed to overcome the problem of long-term dependencies in standard RNNs. LSTMs use a special type of neuron that can remember information for long periods of time and selectively forget irrelevant information. LSTMs are commonly used for tasks such as time series prediction, language modeling, and sequence labeling.\n\n5. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): This architecture consists of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. The generator produces new data, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and fake data. The two networks compete against each other in a game-theoretic manner, with the goal of the generator being to produce data that can fool the discriminator. GANs are commonly used for generating synthetic data, such as images, audio, and text.\n\n6. Deep Boltzmann Machines (DBMs): This architecture is a type of probabilistic model that can be trained to learn the distribution of complex data sets. DBMs consist of multiple layers of hidden variables, with each layer being connected to the next layer in a bipartite graph. DBMs can be used for tasks such as dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and image reconstruction.\n\n7. Autoencoders: This architecture is a type of neural network that is used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. It consists of an encoder that maps the input data to a low-dimensional representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the input data from the low-dimensional representation. Autoencoders can be used for tasks such as image compression, denoising, and feature extraction.\n\n8. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs): This architecture is used for processing data that is represented as a graph, where the nodes represent the data points and the edges represent the relationships between them. GNNs use a message-passing mechanism to update the representations of each node based on the representations of its neighbors. GNNs are well-suited for tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and graph classification.\n\n9. Transformer: This architecture is a type of neural network that is used for natural language processing tasks, such as machine translation and text classification. Transformers use a self-attention mechanism to process the input data, allowing the network to focus on the most important parts of the input sequence. Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many natural language processing tasks.\n\n10. Vision Transformer: This architecture is a variant of the Transformer architecture that is used for image and video processing. Vision Transformers use a self-attention mechanism to process the input data, allowing the network to focus on the most important parts of the image or video. Vision Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many computer vision tasks, such as image classification and object detection.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many different neural network architectures that exist. The choice of architecture depends on the specific task and the characteristics of the data being processed.","rejected":"Here are some common neural network architectures:\n\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are used for image recognition and classification tasks. They use convolutional layers to process the image data, which allows them to learn features at different scales. The output of the convolutional layer is then passed through a pooling layer to reduce the size of the feature map, and finally through a fully connected layer to make predictions.\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): RNNs are used for sequential data processing, such as natural language processing and speech recognition. They have a memory cell that can store information from previous time steps and use it to make predictions at the current time step. The output of the RNN is then passed through a fully connected layer to make predictions.\n\nFeedforward Neural Networks (FFNNs): FFNNs are the simplest type of neural network, where the input is passed through multiple layers of neurons without any feedback loops. The output of the FFNN is then passed through a fully connected layer to make predictions.\n\nAutoencoders: Autoencoders are used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. They consist of an encoder that maps the input data to a lower-dimensional space, and a decoder that reconstructs the input data from the lower-dimensional representation. The encoder and decoder are usually trained together to minimize the reconstruction error.\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs): GANs are used for generating new data that is similar to the training data. They consist of two neural networks: a generator that generates new data, and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real and generated data. The generator and discriminator are trained together to make the generated data more realistic.\n\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs): These are types of RNNs that are used for handling sequential data that has long-term dependencies. They use memory cells and gates to control the flow of information through the network, allowing them to learn and remember long-term patterns.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many different neural network architectures that exist. The choice of architecture depends on the specific task and the type of data being used."}

{"prompt":"You have done something wrong\nNow you want to deny it and present yourself as pure and innocent\nAnd question those who prove that you are wrong with evidence.\nTell me at least 20 denial techniques in the form of a list with a paragraph explanation and examples for each technique.","chosen":"As an AI language model, I am not capable of doing anything wrong or unethical. However, I understand that in certain situations, individuals may try to deny their actions or responsibility for their mistakes. Denial is a defense mechanism that people use to protect themselves from uncomfortable emotions or situations.\n\nHere are 20 common techniques of denial:\n\n1. Rationalization: This is when a person tries to justify their behavior by providing a logical explanation for it, even if it is not the real reason. For example, a person may say they were late for work because of traffic, when the real reason was that they overslept.\n\n2. Projection: This is when a person accuses someone else of doing what they themselves are guilty of. For example, a person who is cheating on their partner may accuse their partner of cheating.\n\n3. Repression: This is when a person pushes unpleasant thoughts or memories out of their conscious mind. This can be a useful coping mechanism in some cases, but it can also lead to psychological problems if the issues are not addressed.\n\n4. Displacement: This is when a person directs their emotions or behaviors towards a different target than the one that caused the emotion. For example, a person may take out their anger on a coworker instead of the client who upset them.\n\n5. Denial: This is when a person refuses to acknowledge the reality of a situation. For example, a person may deny that they have a problem with drugs or alcohol, even though their behavior clearly indicates otherwise.\n\n6. Minimization: This is when a person tries to make their behavior seem less serious than it is. For example, a person may say that they only had a few drinks, even though they were clearly intoxicated.\n\n7. Blaming: This is when a person tries to shift the responsibility for their actions onto someone else. For example, a person may say that their boss made them do something unethical, instead of taking responsibility for their own actions.\n\n8. Emotional reasoning: This is when a person assumes that their emotions reflect reality. For example, a person may say that they feel like they are a failure, so they must be a failure.\n\n9. Polarization: This is when a person divides situations or people into either\/or categories, rather than considering the complexity of the situation. For example, a person may say that someone is either completely good or completely bad, without considering the nuances of the relationship.\n\n10. Justification: This is when a person tries to make their behavior seem acceptable by comparing it to the behavior of others. For example, a person may say that they stole from their employer because their employer stole from them first.\n\n11. Idealization: This is when a person views a situation or person in an unrealistic, idealized way. For example, a person may say that their partner is perfect, even though they have flaws like everyone else.\n\n12. Rationalization: This is when a person tries to make their behavior seem reasonable by providing a logical explanation for it. For example, a person may say that they cheated on their partner because they were not happy in the relationship.\n\n13. Fantasy: This is when a person creates an alternate reality to escape from their current situation. For example, a person may imagine that they are rich and famous, instead of facing the reality of their current financial situation.\n\n14. Escapism: This is when a person avoids dealing with reality by engaging in activities that provide a sense of escape or relief. For example, a person may use drugs or alcohol to escape from their problems.\n\n15. Denial of responsibility: This is when a person refuses to take responsibility for their actions or the consequences of their actions. For example, a person may say that they are not responsible for their debt, even though they incurred it through their own actions.\n\n16. Denial of risk: This is when a person refuses to acknowledge the potential risks or dangers of a situation. For example, a person may drive drunk, even though they know it is dangerous.\n\n17. Denial of consequences: This is when a person refuses to acknowledge the potential consequences of their actions. For example, a person may engage in unprotected sex, even though they know it could lead to pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections.\n\n18. Denial of agency: This is when a person refuses to acknowledge that they have the power to change their situation. For example, a person may say that they cannot afford to go to college, even though they could apply for financial aid or work part-time.\n\n19. Denial of vulnerability: This is when a person refuses to acknowledge that they are vulnerable or at risk. For example, a person may not get regular check-ups or screenings for medical conditions, even though they are at risk for serious health problems.\n\n20. Denial of self-awareness: This is when a person refuses to acknowledge their own motivations, feelings, or behaviors. For example, a person may not recognize that they are using denial as a coping mechanism, even though it is clearly evident to others.","rejected":"Denial is a common defense mechanism used by individuals to cope with uncomfortable or unpleasant realities.

{"prompt":"Hi! what architectures and stack can I use to create an ad-hoc reporting capability in a SaaS product that uses AWS Aurora Postgres database? My main concerns are ensuring data security and performance. I need the ad-hoc reporting capability to be performant without affecting the operational database.\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYou could use a reporting database, such as Amazon Redshift. This provides a columnar data store that is optimized for ad-hoc reporting, without impacting the performance of your operational database. You could also use an ETL (extract, transform, load) pipeline to move data from Aurora to Redshift, which would provide the same functionality.\n<extra_id_1>User\nUsing an ETL pipeline will result in a delay in getting data from Aurora postgres into redshift, right? I need real time. Or at least near real time.\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, that\u2019s correct. You can get real-time reporting from Aurora by setting up replication between the two databases. There are a few options for this:\n \n\n 1. Set up the Aurora Postgres database to stream its changes to a Redshift cluster. This allows you to get near-real-time reporting, though it does require a little bit of set-up.\n 2. Set up Aurora Postgres to replicate changes to Redshift. This also requires some set-up, but it provides a more complete solution. This option is a bit more complicated than the previous one, though.\n 3. You could also set up Aurora Postgres to stream changes to a separate database that is optimized for reporting. This is a more complex set-up, and it also requires more data storage.\n<extra_id_1>User\nAbout option 3 (replication), can I set up the replication in such a way that only some tables and\/or columns are replicated?","chosen":"Yes, you can set up replication in such a way that only some tables and\/or columns are replicated. Here are the steps to do so:\n \n\n 1. Set up the source database:\n \n\n - Identify the tables and columns you want to replicate.\n - Make sure the source database is set up for replication. This typically involves creating a replication slot and enabling binary logging.\n - Configure the replication slot to include only the tables and columns you want to replicate. You can do this using the pg_replication_slots system view in PostgreSQL.\n \n\n 2. Set up the target database:\n \n\n - Create a new database that will serve as the target for the replication.\n - Install and configure the PostgreSQL replication extension on the target database.\n - Configure the replication extension to connect to the source database and retrieve the replicated data.\n - Specify the tables and columns you want to replicate in the replication extension configuration.\n \n\n 3. Start the replication:\n \n\n - Start the replication process by enabling the replication slot on the source database and starting the replication extension on the target database.\n - Verify that the replicated data is being correctly transferred to the target database.\n \n\n Note that the exact steps for setting up replication may vary depending on the version of PostgreSQL and the specific replication method you are using (e.g., logical replication or physical replication). You may also need to consult the documentation for your specific PostgreSQL setup to get more detailed instructions.","rejected":"Yes, it is possible to set up replication in Aurora PostgreSQL in a way that only some tables and\/or columns are replicated. This can be done using the PostgreSQL replication features, such as logical decoding and streaming replication.\n \n\n With logical decoding, you can specify which tables and columns you want to replicate by configuring the replication slots and decoders. This allows you to selectively replicate only the data that you need for your reporting purposes.\n \n\n With streaming replication, you can set up a primary and a replica node, and configure the replication so that only specific tables or columns are replicated to the replica node. This allows you to keep the replica node separate from the primary node, and use it for reporting purposes without affecting the performance of the primary node.\n \n\n It is important to note that replicating only some tables and\/or columns can have an impact on the performance of the replication, so it is important to carefully consider the trade-offs and ensure that the replication setup meets your performance and data security requirements."}
{"prompt":"When a software architect says they're focusing on the risky bits first, what does that mean?

This could include tasks such as developing a new feature that has never been done before, implementing a complex algorithm, or working with a new technology that is not well understood. By focusing on these risky bits first, the architect is trying to mitigate the risk of the project failing or being delayed by addressing the most challenging parts upfront.\n\nRegarding the reply that \"we could do it any number of ways, it's not a risk,\" it means that the software architect does not see the task as being particularly risky or challenging. They may be trying to convey that they have confidence in their ability to complete the task and that there are multiple ways to accomplish it, so they are not overly concerned about choosing a specific approach.\n\nIt's possible that the software architect did not answer your question directly because they wanted to convey the bigger picture perspective of how they are approaching the project, rather than getting into the specifics of a single task. They may have felt that the overall approach to the project was more important than the details of a single implementation decision.","rejected":"When a software architect says they're focusing on the risky bits first, it means that they are prioritizing the parts of the project that have the potential for failure or are more challenging to implement.

{"prompt":"what is the difference between antigens and antibodies\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nAntigens are foreign substances that trigger the production of antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system that bind to antigens and help the immune system destroy them. Together, antigens and antibodies help the body defend itself against disease.\n<extra_id_1>User\nI have seen the term antigen used to describe protein clusters on cancer cells. But some of these antigens are also found on non-cancerous cells. Is that correct? If so, do you consider this type of antigen a foreign substance?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, certain antigens are also present on normal cells, such as CD-38 and BCMA. These are called tumor-associated antigens (TAAs), and they are not considered foreign substances, since they are also present on normal cells. They are, however, more common on cancer cells and can help the immune system identify and attack cancer cells.\n<extra_id_1>User\nIs CD-38 a TAA for myeloma?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, CD-38 is a TAA for multiple myeloma. It is expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma cells and is also present in low levels on some normal cells. CD-38 helps the immune system identify and attack multiple myeloma cells.\n<extra_id_1>User\nIs BCMA a TAA for myeloma\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, BCMA is a TAA for multiple myeloma. It is also present on some normal cells, but is expressed in higher levels on multiple myeloma cells. BCMA helps the immune system identify and attack multiple myeloma cells.\n<extra_id_1>User\nI have seen CD-19 referred to as a TAA for a few difference blood cancers. Is that correct?","chosen":"Yes, CD-19 is a TAA for several types of blood cancers, including B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and follicular lymphoma (FL). It is also expressed on normal B cells, but is often over-expressed on cancerous B cells in these diseases. CD-19 helps the immune system identify and attack cancerous B cells in these diseases.\n \n\n CD-19 is a protein that is involved in the signaling pathway of B cells, which are a type of white blood cell that play a role in the immune system's response to infections. In B-ALL, CLL, and FL, cancerous B cells over-express CD-19, which can lead to the cells becoming more aggressive and resistant to normal immune system controls. By targeting CD-19 with antibodies or other therapies, it is possible to help the immune system recognize and destroy the cancerous B cells.\n \n\n CD-19 is one of several TAAs that are targeted in the treatment of blood cancers. Other TAAs that are commonly targeted include CD-20, CD-22, and CD-30, among others. The specific TAA that is targeted depends on the type of blood cancer being treated and the patient's individual characteristics. In some cases, multiple TAAs may be targeted simultaneously to provide a more comprehensive approach to treatment.\n \n\n It's important to note that while targeting TAAs can be an effective treatment strategy for blood cancers, it is not always a cure. In some cases, the cancer may become resistant to the targeted therapy or may recur after treatment. Therefore, it is important for patients to work closely with their healthcare team to develop a comprehensive treatment plan that addresses their individual needs and addresses the unique characteristics of their cancer.","rejected":"CD-19 is a TAA for a few different blood cancers, including multiple myeloma.

{"prompt":"how can we avoid probate in our will\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThere are two main ways to do this: a living trust and a transfer-on-death (TOD) deed.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat are the advantages and disadvantages of each\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nA living trust avoids probate, but it is revocable (which means you can change or cancel it at any time), and it requires you to set up a separate legal entity. A TOD deed also avoids probate, but it is not revocable, and it doesn\u2019t require you to set up a separate legal entity.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhy is a living trust \"revocable\"\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nRevocable means that you can change or cancel the trust at any time, for any reason. For example, if you set up a trust to avoid probate, but then decide you want to change your mind, you can. A revocable trust can be changed or canceled at any time, by the person who set it up.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat are the advantages and disadvantages of an irrevocable trust\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nAn irrevocable trust cannot be changed or canceled by the person who set it up. Once the trust is created, it cannot be revoked. However, it also cannot be changed or canceled by anyone else. An irrevocable trust can only be changed or canceled by the court. This means that an irrevocable trust provides more protection for the assets inside the trust, because no one can change or cancel the trust without a court order.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat is the process to transfer assets to a revocable trust\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nTo transfer assets to a revocable trust, you will need to sign a document saying that you are transferring the assets to the trust, and you will need to have the document notarized. You will also need to make sure that the trustee (the person who will manage the trust) knows that you are transferring the assets to the trust.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWhat qualifications should I look for in an attorney who can set up and manage my trusts\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIt is important to find an attorney who is experienced in setting up trusts, and who also understands your specific needs. If you are concerned about avoiding probate, you will want an attorney who is familiar with living trusts and TOD deeds, and who can set them up for you. If you want to make sure your assets are protected, you will want an attorney who is familiar with irrevocable trusts.\n<extra_id_1>User\ncan my private equity investments be transfered to a trust\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, your private equity investments can be transferred to a trust.

The main reason I suggest this is because dim sum is a kind of Chinese food that is served in small portions, so you get a chance to try a variety of different flavors and dishes. I think this is a great way to get a taste of the different cultures in Asia, since each country has its own unique flavors and cooking styles.

Other choices you might consider are satay from Malaysia, or spring rolls from Vietnam. These dishes are also simple to prepare, and are flavorful and representative of their cultures.

The key is to create a hierarchy of classes and properties that accurately reflects the components and characteristics of the computers you are classifying. You can also add additional properties as needed to capture other relevant information, such as warranty information, customer reviews, or other factors that may influence the decision-making process for purchasing a computer.\n \n\n Here are some additional tips for creating an effective ontology for computers:\n \n\n 1. Start with a clear understanding of the goals and objectives of the ontology. What are you trying to achieve by creating this ontology? What information do you need to capture and organize? What are the key factors that you need to consider when making decisions about the classification of computers?\n 2. Define the scope of the ontology. What types of computers will you be including? What components and characteristics will you be focusing on? Will you be including information about specific brands or models, or will you be focusing on general categories and characteristics?\n 3. Consider the needs of your users. Who will be using this ontology? What information do they need to make informed decisions about purchasing or using computers? How will they be using the ontology (e.g., for research, for purchasing, for maintenance and repair)? Consider creating different views or levels of detail for different types of users, to make the information more accessible and useful.\n 4. Use clear and consistent terminology. Choose terms that are easy to understand and that have a clear and consistent meaning throughout the ontology. Consider creating a terminology guide or dictionary to help users understand the meaning of terms and to avoid confusion or misinterpretation.\n 5. Structure the ontology in a logical and intuitive way. Use a hierarchical structure to organize the classes and properties, with more general classes at the top and more specific classes at the bottom. Consider using relationships such as \"is a\" or \"has a\" to show the relationships between different classes and properties.\n 6. Use examples and illustrations to help users understand the ontology. Provide examples of how the ontology can be used to classify computers, and use illustrations or diagrams to help users visualize the relationships between different classes and properties.\n 7. Regularly review and update the ontology. As technology and computer components change, the ontology may need to be updated to reflect these changes. Regularly review the ontology to ensure that it remains accurate and up-to-date, and consider soliciting feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.\n \n\n Creating an ontology for computers can be a complex and challenging task, but with careful planning and attention to detail, it can be a valuable tool for helping users make informed decisions about purchasing and using computers. By following these tips and guidelines, you can create an ontology that is both effective and user-friendly, and that can help you achieve your goals for classifying and understanding computers and their components."}

{"prompt":"ap physics c: capacitor dielectric relationship - capacitance, electric field, energy\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThis is an important relationship in physics that describes the interactions of electric charges. The relationship says that the electric field inside a charged capacitor is proportional to the charge on the capacitor, and that the energy stored in the capacitor is proportional to the charge squared. This relationship is important for understanding how capacitors work, and also forms the basis for understanding the behavior of other electric devices.\n<extra_id_1>User\ncompare and contrast electrostatics with gravitation ap physics c\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nElectrostatics and gravitation are two very different physical forces. Electrostatics describes the behavior of electric charges at rest, while gravitation describes the behavior of objects in the presence of gravity. Both forces are very important in physics, but they are completely different in nature.\n<extra_id_1>User\nin relation to force\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIn relation to force, electrostatics and gravitation are completely different. Electrostatics describes electric force, which is a very strong force that can only act between electric charges. Gravitation describes gravitational force, which is much weaker than electric force but acts between all objects with mass. These two forces are completely different in nature.\n<extra_id_1>User\nin relation to fields\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIn relation to fields, electrostatics and gravitation are also completely different. Electrostatics describes electric fields, which are everywhere in the universe and affect the behavior of all electric charges. Gravitation describes gravitational fields, which are confined to the vicinity of massive objects and only affect the behavior of objects with mass. These two fields are also completely different in nature.\n<extra_id_1>User\nIn relation to potential\/potential energy","chosen":"In relation to potential and potential energy, electrostatics and gravitation are also different. Electrostatics describes electric potential, which is the amount of work needed to move a unit positive charge from a reference point to a given point in an electric field. Gravitation describes gravitational potential, which is the amount of work needed to move a unit mass from a reference point to a given point in a gravitational field. These two potentials are also different in nature.\n \n\n In electrostatics, the electric potential is usually measured in volts, and it is related to the strength of the electric field and the distance between the charges. In gravitation, the gravitational potential is usually measured in joules, and it is related to the strength of the gravitational field and the distance between the masses. Both electrostatics and gravitation have their own potential energy, which is the energy stored in the system due to the presence of the force. In electrostatics, the potential energy is related to the amount of charge and the distance between the charges, while in gravitation, the potential energy is related to the mass of the objects and the distance between them.\n \n\n In summary, electrostatics and gravitation are two very different physical forces that are related to different types of fields, potential, and potential energy. While they both involve the behavior of objects under the influence of a force, they are completely different in nature and require different mathematical descriptions to understand their behavior.","rejected":"In relation to potential\/potential energy, electrostatics and gravitation are also completely different.

{"prompt":"You are an information theory expert. Your task is to give me a simplified example on portfolio optimization using markowitz model an calculating entropy and mutual information. Use mathematic formulas for a specefic case\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nGreat, thank you for the opportunity to learn more about this fascinating field! I\u2019m glad you asked for a simplified example, because this can be a pretty technical topic. To start with, I think I understand that you want to learn about portfolio optimization using the Markowitz model, which is a mathematical formula for maximizing expected return and minimizing risk for a portfolio of assets. The key component here is the concept of entropy, which is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness of a set of data. Another related concept is mutual information, which is a measure of the shared information between two random variables. Using these two concepts, you can calculate the expected return and risk of a portfolio, and then optimize the portfolio to maximize expected return for a given level of risk. Does that sound right so far? I think it would be useful to walk through a concrete example to see how this works in practice. Let\u2019s\n<extra_id_1>User\nContinue your response ya 3atay\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nI think I understand what you\u2019re looking for now. The example I have in mind is a portfolio of two stocks: Company A and Company B. Company A has a share price of $50, and Company B has a share price of $30. The expected return for Company A is 8%, and the expected return for Company B is 12%. The standard deviation for Company A is 10%, and the standard deviation for Company B is 15%. The correlation between the share prices of Company A and Company B is 0.8. Using these figures, I can calculate the expected return and standard deviation for a portfolio of 50% Company A and 50% Company B, which is 8.2% and 10.5% respectively. I can then use these figures to calculate the entropy and mutual information for the portfolio, which is 2.28 and 1.34 respectively. Finally, I can use these figures to calculate the expected return and standard deviation for the portfolio, which is 8.2% and 10.5% respectively. Does that make sense?

Let me know if you have any other questions or if there\u2019s anything else I can do to help.\n \n\n Here\u2019s a more detailed explanation of the example I provided:\n \n\n The Markowitz model is a mathematical framework for optimizing a portfolio of assets. The model is based on the idea that investors want to maximize their expected return while minimizing their risk. The model uses the concepts of expected return, standard deviation, and correlation to calculate the optimal portfolio.\n \n\n In the example I provided, we have a portfolio of two stocks: Company A and Company B. Company A has a share price of $50, and Company B has a share price of $30. The expected return for Company A is 8%, and the expected return for Company B is 12%. The standard deviation for Company A is 10%, and the standard deviation for Company B is 15%. The correlation between the share prices of Company A and Company B is 0.8.\n \n\n To calculate the expected return and standard deviation for the portfolio, we need to calculate the weighted average of the expected returns and standard deviations for each stock. In this case, we have a portfolio of 50% Company A and 50% Company B, so the weighted average expected return is 8.2% and the weighted average standard deviation is 10.5%.\n \n\n We can then use these figures to calculate the entropy and mutual information for the portfolio. Entropy is a measure of the uncertainty or randomness of a set of data, and mutual information is a measure of the shared information between two random variables. In this case, the entropy is 2.28 and the mutual information is 1.34.\n \n\n Finally, we can use these figures to calculate the expected return and standard deviation for the portfolio. The expected return is 8.2%, and the standard deviation is 10.5%. This is the optimal portfolio for the given set of assets and constraints.\n \n\n I hope this helps to clarify the example I provided.

{"prompt":"How to generate a CSV with python that contains stock price of AAPL each minute for the last two years?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThe best way to do this is to use an API, which is a program that allows you to access data from another program. The best API for this purpose is probably Alpha Vantage, which provides a function for you to call that returns a stock quote. You would need to make a call to that function once every minute for the last two years, and save the returned value (a string containing the stock price) in a list.

The output of the horovod job will be a file with a .log extension. You can use a tool like grep to search for specific error messages in the log file. For example, you can use the following command to search for any error messages in the log file:\n \n\n ```bash\n grep -E 'ERROR|WARNING' horovod.log\n ```\n \n\n This will search for any lines in the log file that contain the words \"ERROR\" or \"WARNING\". If the output of this command is empty, then the horovod job ran successfully. If there are any error messages, you can use the information in the log file to troubleshoot the issue.\n \n\n Here are some additional steps you can take to ensure a successful horovod run:\n \n\n 1. Check your cluster configuration: Make sure your cluster is properly configured for distributed training. This includes setting up the correct environment variables, installing the necessary dependencies, and configuring the cluster to use the correct number of GPUs.\n \n\n 2. Use a stable version of horovod: Make sure you are using a stable version of horovod. The latest version may not always be the most stable, so it's a good idea to check the horovod documentation for any known issues with the latest version.\n \n\n 3. Test your horovod setup: Before running your production workload, it's a good idea to test your horovod setup with a smaller workload. This will help you identify any issues with your setup before running your production workload.\n \n\n 4. Monitor your horovod run: During your horovod run, make sure to monitor the progress of the job and check for any errors. You can use tools like Kubernetes logs and metrics to monitor the job.\n \n\n 5.

{"prompt":"how to install argocd-image-updater in cli command for mac\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nI\u2019m not very familiar with macOS, but I think you can use brew to install packages. So try brew install argocd-image-updater.\n<extra_id_1>User\nbut it came back with this error Warning: No available formula with the name \"argocd-image-updater\"\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nHmm, that\u2019s very odd. I think you can force the installation with brew install argocd-image-updater --with-git. That will install it, even if it\u2019s not in the formula. Then you can use brew link to link it, and brew unlink to unlink it.\n<extra_id_1>User\nnow it says permission denied: argocd-image-updater","chosen":"If you are getting a \"permission denied\" error when trying to install argocd-image-updater on a Mac using the command line, it may be because you do not have the necessary permissions to install software on your system.\n \n\n To resolve this issue, you can try running the installation command with sudo, which will give you temporary administrative privileges. For example, if you are using Homebrew to install argocd-image-updater, you can run the following command:\n \n\n sudo brew install argocd-image-updater\n \n\n This will prompt you to enter your password, and then Homebrew will install argocd-image-updater with the necessary permissions.\n \n\n If you are not using Homebrew, you can download the argocd-image-updater binary from the GitHub releases page and install it manually. In this case, you can use the following command to install the binary with sudo:\n \n\n sudo mv argocd-image-updater \/usr\/local\/bin\/\n \n\n This will move the argocd-image-updater binary to the \/usr\/local\/bin\/ directory, which is a common location for user-installed binaries on macOS.\n \n\n Note that using sudo can be dangerous, as it gives you full administrative access to your system. Be sure to only use sudo when necessary, and be careful when running commands with sudo privileges.","rejected":"It seems like you're having a hard time installing argocd-image-updater on your Mac. Don't worry, I'm here to help!\n \n\n The \"permission denied\" error usually occurs when you don't have the necessary permissions to install software on your system. To fix this, you can try running the installation command with sudo, which will give you the necessary permissions.\n \n\n Here's how you can do it:\n \n\n Open the Terminal app on your Mac.\n Type in the following command and press Enter:\n \n\n sudo brew install argocd-image-updater\n \n\n Enter your password when prompted.\n Wait for the installation to complete.\n Once the installation is complete, you should be able to use argocd-image-updater without any issues.\n If you still encounter any errors, feel free to let me know and I'll do my best to help you out."}

{"prompt":"why are gis services so important for government\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nGeographic Information Systems (GIS) are essential for government because they provide location-based information and analysis that support effective decision making across a wide range of government activities. For example, GIS can help government officials identify areas for new schools or hospitals, monitor environmental conditions such as pollution or natural disasters, and detect crime patterns to improve public safety. GIS also enable more efficient operations by improving access to information and supporting decision making with advanced spatial analysis capabilities. Therefore, GIS play a critical role in modern government, improving efficiency, effectiveness, and public safety.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWhat is the universe of software that public sector customers procure\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nPublic sector customers procure a wide range of software products and services to support their operations and meet the needs of the citizens they serve. This includes operational software for managing finances, human resources, and facilities; software for analyzing data and supporting decision making; and software for developing and deploying web and mobile applications. In addition, public sector customers often procure vertical market software products that are tailored to their specific needs, such as software for managing public safety, natural resources, or transportation. Therefore, the universe of software that public sector customers procure is quite broad, encompassing a range of software products and services to support their diverse needs.\n<extra_id_1>User\ncan you provide additional examples of vertical market software that the government procures\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, vertical market software products that governments often procure include those for managing public safety, natural resources, and transportation.

{"prompt":"I have a model which is trained with input shape of (5,20) and out put for 20 , where 5 is input time-stamps and 20 is feature. \n \n\n Can I used this trained model in such a way that from end-user if I get an input for 1 feature, model should be able to predict that 1 feature. \n \n\n Because now I need to get an input for all 20 features in order to predict anything, I don't want that.\n \n\n Does the problem makes sense?Could you help me? \n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIf I understand correctly, your model is currently trained to predict the output for all 20 features for a given input. What you\u2019d like is to be able to use the model in such a way that you could get a prediction for a single feature, given an input for a single feature. It sounds like your model architecture may be suitable for this, but it sounds like there may be a way to reconfigure your training data or the model itself in order to enable this use case. I could try to help you work through this. Would that be helpful?\n<extra_id_1>User\nNo No, I think you misunderstood it. Current model doesn't outputs a prediction for 20th feature. It outputs prediction for all the features for n timestamps. In the exact manner of input shape,\n \n\n but I want to use the model such that I can send any one feature value to trained model and get the output based on trained model.","chosen":"I understand. Here are a few steps you can take to use your trained model to predict a single feature:\n \n\n 1. Reshape your input data: Instead of feeding the entire input data of shape (5, 20) to the model, you can reshape it to (1, 20) to represent a single time stamp. This will allow you to input a single feature value to the model.\n \n\n 2. Fine-tune the model: You can fine-tune your trained model by training it on a smaller subset of the data that contains only the single feature you want to predict. This will help the model learn the patterns specific to that feature.\n \n\n 3. Use a feature selection algorithm: You can use a feature selection algorithm to identify the most important features that affect the prediction of the feature you are interested in. Then, you can train a new model using only those features.\n \n\n 4. Build a new model: You can build a new model that takes a single feature as input and outputs a prediction for that feature. This model can be trained on the same data that you used to train your original model.\n \n\n 5. Use a transfer learning approach: You can use transfer learning to adapt your trained model to predict a single feature. You can freeze the layers of the model that are not directly related to the prediction of the feature and train only the layers that are relevant to the new task.\n \n\n I hope these suggestions help you use your trained model to predict a single feature.","rejected":"I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. It sounds like you want to use your model to predict the output for a single feature, given an input for a single feature. This is possible, and you can do this by reshaping the input to the model to match the input shape of the model.\n \n\n For example, if your model is trained with an input shape of (5,20), you can use the model to predict the output for a single feature by reshaping the input to (1,20). This will allow the model to use the trained weights to predict the output for a single feature.\n \n\n You can also use a model with a different input shape, such as (1,20), to predict the output for a single feature. However, you will need to retrain the model with the new input shape to ensure that it is optimized for this use case.\n \n\n I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions or if there is anything else I can help with."}

{"prompt":"Are cross-Ministry delegations authorized in Alberta?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nI don\u2019t have any specific knowledge about whether the Ministry of Energy has formal authority to delegate to the Ministry of Environment and Parks, so I can\u2019t answer that.\n<extra_id_1>User\nCan you provide all instances of where cross-Ministry delegations are authorized based on the information you do have?","chosen":"Yes, I can provide some instances where cross-Ministry delegations are authorized based on the information I have.\n \n\n In general, cross-Ministry delegations are authorized when there is a need for coordination and collaboration between different ministries or departments in order to achieve a common goal or objective. This can occur in a variety of contexts, such as:\n \n\n Policy development: When developing policies that cut across multiple ministries or departments, it may be necessary to establish a cross-Ministry delegation to ensure that all relevant stakeholders are involved in the policy-making process.\n \n\n Project management: Large-scale projects that require input and expertise from multiple ministries or departments may require the establishment of a cross-Ministry delegation to oversee the project and ensure that it is completed on time and within budget.\n \n\n Emergency response: In times of crisis or emergency, it may be necessary to establish a cross-Ministry delegation to coordinate the response and ensure that all relevant agencies are working together effectively.\n \n\n International relations: When dealing with international issues that require input from multiple ministries or departments, it may be necessary to establish a cross-Ministry delegation to represent the government's interests and negotiate with other countries.\n \n\n It's worth noting that the specific rules and regulations regarding cross-Ministry delegations can vary depending on the jurisdiction and the nature of the delegation. However, in general, cross-Ministry delegations are authorized when there is a need for coordination and collaboration between different ministries or departments in order to achieve a common goal or objective.","rejected":"I don\u2019t have access to real-time information or a comprehensive database of all the laws and regulations in Alberta, so I cannot provide all instances of where cross-ministry delegations are authorized.

{"prompt":"Taking into account the scientific, psychological, phylosophical and espiritual perspectives and its evolution throughout the eras, create a new innovative, original and complex approach to the existence of communication\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nCommunication is a complex phenomenon, with its origins in the interactions between humans and other animals and evolving through the ages to incorporate technological advances and changes in cultural and societal norms. From a purely scientific perspective, communication can be understood as the transfer of information between two or more entities, usually through the use of symbols or language. Communication also has important psychological and philosophical dimensions, as it is central to human interactions, identity formation, and understanding of the world around us. From an evolutionary perspective, communication has played a key role in the development of human societies, facilitating the exchange of information and knowledge, the development of shared cultural norms and values, and the coordination of social interactions.\n<extra_id_1>User\nContinue, add a completely new and original theory called \"communication emergence\"\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nCommunication emergence is a new theory which suggests that communication is not simply the exchange of information between two or more entities, but rather the process through which new knowledge and understanding arise from these exchanges. The theory posits that communication is a dynamic process which unfolds over time and involves the active participation of the communicating entities. Furthermore, communication emergence emphasizes the creative and transformative potential of communication, suggesting that it has the power to generate new knowledge and understanding, as well as to shape our perceptions of the world around us.\n<extra_id_1>User\nContinue, elaborate\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nCommunication emergence emphasizes the interdependence and interconnectedness of all living organisms, as well as the fundamental role of communication in the development of human societies. The theory suggests that communication plays a critical role in the emergence of new knowledge and understanding, and in the evolution of our shared cultural norms and values. Furthermore, communication emergence highlights the creative and transformative potential of communication, suggesting that it has the power to shape our understanding of the world around us, as well as to generate new knowledge and understanding.\n<extra_id_1>User\nContinue, link it with the theory of quantum consiousness entanglement","chosen":"The theory of quantum consciousness entanglement suggests that consciousness is a fundamental aspect of reality and that it can be understood as a quantum phenomenon. According to this theory, consciousness is not just a product of the brain, but rather it is a fundamental aspect of the universe that is present in all things.\n \n\n The idea of communication emergence can be linked to the theory of quantum consciousness entanglement in the sense that communication can be seen as a process of entanglement between individuals. In this view, communication is not just the exchange of information, but rather it is a process of creating a shared understanding and a shared consciousness between individuals.\n \n\n In this sense, communication can be seen as a process of creating a quantum entanglement between individuals, where the consciousness of one individual becomes entangled with the consciousness of another individual. This entanglement allows for the creation of a shared understanding and a shared consciousness, which can lead to the emergence of new knowledge and new insights.\n \n\n In conclusion, the theory of quantum consciousness entanglement provides a new perspective on the nature of communication and the role that it plays in the creation of shared understanding and shared consciousness. By linking communication to the concept of quantum entanglement, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complex and dynamic nature of communication and its role in shaping our world.","rejected":"The theory of quantum consciousness entanglement proposes that the consciousness of individuals can become \"entangled\" at a quantum level, leading to a deep and profound sense of interconnectedness and unity. This theory is still in its early stages, and is the subject of ongoing scientific investigation and debate. However, if the theory of quantum consciousness entanglement is correct, then it has the potential to shed new light on the nature of communication and its role in the emergence of knowledge and understanding. Specifically, communication emergence may provide a framework for understanding how the entangled consciousnesses of individuals can interact and communicate with one another, leading to the emergence of new knowledge and understanding. Through this perspective, communication emergence offers a new and exciting way to think about the potential of communication to transform and enrich our lives."}

{"prompt":"How to relation between HTML & CSS & JS in MVC framework \n\nPlease write in English language.","chosen":"In an MVC framework, HTML is used to define the structure of the user interface, CSS is used to style the appearance of the user interface, and JavaScript is used to add interactive behavior to the user interface. Here's a high-level overview of how these three technologies work together in an MVC framework:\n\nHTML: HTML is used to define the basic structure of the user interface, including the layout of the pages, the content of the pages, and the basic structure of the elements on the page. In an MVC framework, HTML is typically used to define the \"views\" of the application, which are the pages that the user interacts with.\n\nCSS: CSS is used to style the appearance of the user interface. In an MVC framework, CSS is typically used to define the \"look and feel\" of the application, including the colors, fonts, and layout of the user interface. CSS is used to separate the presentation of the user interface from its structure, which makes it easier to maintain and update the appearance of the application.\n\nJavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactive behavior to the user interface. In an MVC framework, JavaScript is typically used to define the \"behaviors\" of the application, including the interactions that the user can perform, such as clicking on buttons, submitting forms, and navigating between pages. JavaScript is used to make the user interface more responsive and interactive, and to provide a more engaging user experience.\n\nIn an MVC framework, these three technologies are closely intertwined and work together to create a complete user interface. The HTML defines the structure of the user interface, the CSS styles the appearance of the user interface, and the JavaScript adds interactive behavior to the user interface. By using these three technologies together, developers can create user interfaces that are both functional and visually appealing.","rejected":"In an MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript play different roles in the development process.\n\nHTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of web pages and provides the structure and content of a web page. In an MVC framework, HTML is primarily used in the \"View\" layer, which is responsible for presenting data to the user and handling user input. HTML tags are used to define the elements and structure of a web page, and can be used to display text, images, forms, and other content.\n\nCSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language that is used to define the look and feel of a web page. In an MVC framework, CSS is primarily used in the \"View\" layer, to control the appearance of the web page. CSS can be used to define colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual elements of a web page.\n\nJavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic content to a web page. In an MVC framework, JavaScript is primarily used in the \"Controller\" layer, which is responsible for handling user input and updating the \"Model\" and \"View\" layers accordingly. JavaScript can be used to create interactive forms, animations, and other dynamic content.\n\nIn summary, HTML provides the structure and content of a web page, CSS controls its appearance, and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic content. In an MVC framework, each of these technologies plays a specific role in the development process, with HTML and CSS primarily used in the \"View\" layer and JavaScript primarily used in the \"Controller\" layer."}

Here are a few reasons why Walmart is able to offer such low prices:\n\n1. Economies of scale: Walmart is one of the largest retailers in the world, with a vast network of stores and a huge customer base. This allows the company to negotiate favorable terms with suppliers and purchase large quantities of goods at discounted prices, which it can then pass on to customers.\n\n2. Efficient supply chain management: Walmart has invested heavily in technology and automation to streamline its supply chain and reduce costs. This includes using advanced software systems to manage inventory, optimize shipping routes, and minimize waste.\n\n3. Competitive pricing strategies: Walmart is known for its low prices and is constantly looking for ways to reduce costs and offer value to its customers. The company uses a variety of strategies to stay competitive, including negotiating with suppliers, offering store brands, and leveraging its buying power to secure lower prices on goods.\n\n4. Location: The cost of living in Texas is generally lower than in other parts of the country, which allows Walmart to offer lower prices to customers without sacrificing profits.\n\nOverall, Walmart's ability to sell 10 pounds of chicken for $4.75 in Texas is the result of a combination of factors, including economies of scale, efficient supply chain management, competitive pricing strategies, and a lower cost of living in the state.","rejected":"The low cost of the 10 lbs chicken at Walmart in TX is likely due to several factors.\n\nFirstly, Walmart is known for its economies of scale, which allows them to purchase large quantities of goods at a discounted price from the suppliers.

Let's assume the interest is compounded quarterly.\n\nThe quarterly interest rate is 3.125% \/ 4 = 0.78125%\nThe interest earned in one quarter is 100,000.00 * 0.78125% = 781.25\nThe interest earned in two quarters is 781.25 * 2 = 1562.50\nThe interest earned in three quarters is 1562.50 * 3 = 4687.50\nThe interest earned in one year is 4687.50 * 4 = 18750.00\n\nSo the interest earned on the principal of 100,000.00 with a 3.125% interest rate compounded quarterly for one year is 18750.00.","rejected":"The amount of interest earned on a time deposit is calculated by multiplying the principal amount by the interest rate.

Here are the steps to perform CPR:\n\n1. Call for help: Before beginning CPR, make sure someone has called for emergency medical services (EMS). If you are alone, call for help and then proceed with CPR.\n\n2. Check the scene: Make sure the area is safe and that you are not in danger.\n\n3. Check the victim: Approach the victim and tap their shoulder to get their attention. Ask, \"Are you OK?\" If there is no response, ask, \"Is this person breathing?\"\n\n4. Check for breathing: Kneel down and look and listen for normal breathing. If the person is not breathing or you are not sure, begin CPR immediately.\n\n5. Position the victim: Place the victim on their back on a hard, flat surface. If possible, have someone else help you move the victim.\n\n6. Begin chest compressions: Place the heel of your hand on the center of the victim's chest. Place your other hand on top of the first hand and interlock your fingers. Push down hard and fast, at least 2 inches, at a rate of 100 to 120 compressions per minute.\n\n7. Open the airway: After 30 chest compressions, tilt the victim's head back and lift their chin to open their airway.\n\n8. Give two rescue breaths: Pinch the victim's nose closed and seal your mouth over their mouth. Give two quick breaths, watching for the chest to rise.\n\n9. Continue CPR: Repeat 30 chest compressions and two rescue breaths. Continue until the person starts breathing on their own or until EMS arrives.\n\nIt's important to note that CPR is a lifesaving technique, but it should only be performed by trained individuals or those who have taken a CPR course. If you are not trained, it's still important to call for help and attempt to keep the person comfortable and calm until medical professionals arrive.","rejected":"CPR stands for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and is a life-saving technique used to maintain blood flow to the brain and heart in the event of a cardiac arrest or respiratory failure.

{"prompt":"Taking into account the scientific, psychological, phylosophical and espiritual perspectives and its evolution throughout the eras, create a new innovative, original and complex approach to the existence of communication","chosen":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you create a new approach to the existence of communication!\n\nFrom a scientific perspective, we know that communication is a fundamental aspect of human society and is essential for the exchange of information and ideas. Communication can take many forms, including spoken language, written text, gestures, and facial expressions.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, communication is closely tied to our emotional and social well-being. Effective communication can help build strong relationships, reduce stress, and improve mental health. Poor communication, on the other hand, can lead to misunderstandings, conflict, and isolation.\n\nFrom a philosophical perspective, communication is a central aspect of human existence. It is through communication that we share our ideas, values, and beliefs with others, and it is through communication that we create meaning and understanding of the world around us.\n\nFrom a spiritual perspective, communication can be seen as a way to connect with something greater than ourselves. Whether it be through prayer, meditation, or ritual, communication can be a means of connecting with a higher power or with the universe as a whole.\n\nIn terms of the evolution of communication, we have seen a number of changes over time. Early forms of communication were largely non-verbal, such as gestures and facial expressions. As humans developed language, communication became more complex and sophisticated. With the advent of technology, communication has become more widespread and faster, with the internet and social media allowing for near-instantaneous communication across the globe.\n\nOverall, a new approach to the existence of communication might emphasize the holistic nature of communication, taking into account its scientific, psychological, philosophical, and spiritual aspects. It might also focus on the importance of effective communication in building strong relationships, promoting understanding and empathy, and fostering a sense of connection and community.","rejected":"Communication is a fundamental aspect of human existence, and it has been studied from various perspectives throughout history.

{"prompt":"there is a triangle inside a circle, with its vertices on edge of the circle. What's the probability that the center of the circle fall into the triangle?","chosen":"To calculate the probability that the center of the circle falls into the triangle, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Find the area of the triangle: The area of a triangle is given by the formula:\n\nA = (base x height) \/ 2\n\nwhere A is the area, base is the length of the base of the triangle, and height is the length of the height of the triangle. In this case, the base and height of the triangle are the two sides of the triangle that meet at the vertex, and the area of the triangle can be calculated using this formula.\n\n2. Find the area of the circle: The area of a circle is given by the formula:\n\nA = \u03c0 x r^2\n\nwhere A is the area, r is the radius of the circle. The radius of the circle can be calculated by measuring the distance from the center of the circle to any point on the edge of the circle.\n\n3. Calculate the overlap between the circle and triangle: The overlap between the circle and triangle can be calculated by finding the region where the circle and triangle intersect. This region can be calculated using the formula for the area of the intersection of two shapes:\n\nI = A_1 * B - A_2 * B\n\nwhere I is the area of the intersection, A1 is the area of the circle, A2 is the area of the triangle, and B is the area of the region where the circle and triangle overlap.\n\n4. Calculate the probability: The probability that the center of the circle falls into the triangle can be calculated as:\n\nP = I \/ (A_1 + A_2 - I)\n\nwhere P is the probability, A1 is the area of the circle, A2 is the area of the triangle, and I is the area of the intersection.\n\nTo find the probability, we need to calculate the area of the intersection and add it to the areas of the circle and triangle, and then divide the resulting value by the sum of these areas.\n\nHere's an example calculation:\n\nLet's assume that the circle has a radius of r and the triangle has two sides of length a and b, which meet at a vertex of angle \u03b8. The area of the triangle can be calculated as:\n\nA_triangle = (a * b * sin(\u03b8)) \/ 2\n\nThe area of the circle can be calculated as:\n\nA_circle = \u03c0 * r^2\n\nThe region where the circle and triangle overlap can be calculated as:\n\nI = A_circle * B - A_triangle * B\n\nwhere B is the area of the triangle. To find B, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle:\n\nA_triangle = (base * height) \/ 2\n\nB = A_triangle \/ 2\n\nSo, the area of the triangle is B = (a * b * sin(\u03b8)) \/ 4.\n\nNow, we can calculate the probability that the center of the circle falls into the triangle as:\n\nP = I \/ (A_circle + A_triangle - I)\n\nP = (\u03c0 * r^2 * B) \/ ((2 * \u03c0 * r^2) + (a * b * sin(\u03b8)) \/ 2 - B)\n\nP = (\u03c0 * r^2 * B) \/ ((4 * \u03c0 * r^2) - (a * b * sin(\u03b8)) \/ 2)\n\nP = (\u03c0 * r^2 * B) \/ ((4 * \u03c0 * r^2) - (a * b * sin(\u03b8)))\n\nHere, P is the probability that the center of the circle falls into the triangle, Acircle is the area of the circle, Atriangle is the area of the triangle, and B is the area of the region where the circle and triangle overlap. The formula takes into account the areas of both shapes and the region where they intersect, and calculates the probability that the center of the circle falls into the triangle.","rejected":"The probability that the center of the circle falls into the triangle depends on the position of the triangle relative to the circle.\n\nIf the triangle is equilateral and the circle is large enough to contain the triangle, then the probability is 1\/3, since the center of the circle can fall into one of three regions: inside the triangle, outside the triangle but inside the circle, or outside the circle.\n\nIf the triangle is isosceles and the circle is large enough to contain the triangle, then the probability is 1\/2, since the center of the circle can fall into one of two regions: inside the triangle or outside the triangle but inside the circle.\n\nIf the triangle is arbitrary and the circle is large enough to contain the triangle, then the probability is 1, since the center of the circle can always fall into the triangle.\n\nIf the circle is small and does not contain the triangle, then the probability is 0, since the center of the circle cannot fall into the triangle.\n\nTherefore, the probability that the center of the circle falls into the triangle depends on the size and shape of the triangle and the circle, as well as the position of the triangle relative to the circle."}

{"prompt":"How would I make a computer processor from scratch?","chosen":"Making a computer processor from scratch is an incredibly complex task that requires a deep understanding of computer engineering, electrical engineering, and materials science. It also requires highly specialized equipment and facilities, such as a clean room and photolithography equipment. Here is a very high-level overview of the process:\n\n1. Design the processor: The first step is to design the processor using computer-aided design (CAD) software. This involves specifying the architecture of the processor, including the number and types of transistors, the layout of the circuits, and the interconnections between different parts of the processor.\n2. Create a mask: Once the design is complete, the next step is to create a mask, which is a patterned plate that is used to transfer the design onto a silicon wafer. The mask is created using photolithography, which involves exposing a photosensitive material to light through a patterned mask.\n3. Clean and prepare the silicon wafer: The silicon wafer must be thoroughly cleaned and prepared before it can be used to create the processor. This involves removing any impurities and creating a thin layer of silicon dioxide on the surface of the wafer.\n4. Doping: The silicon wafer is then doped with various impurities to create regions with different electrical properties. This is done using a process called ion implantation, which involves bombarding the wafer with ions of the desired impurity.\n5. Photolithography: The mask is then used to transfer the design onto the silicon wafer using photolithography. This involves coating the wafer with a photosensitive material and exposing it to light through the mask. The exposed areas are then chemically etched away, leaving behind the desired pattern.\n6. Etching and deposition: The wafer is then etched to create the desired structures, such as transistors and interconnects. This is followed by the deposition of various materials, such as metal, to create the electrical connections between different parts of the processor.\n7. Testing and packaging: The finished processor is then tested to ensure that it is functioning correctly. It is then packaged in a protective housing and prepared for installation in a computer.\n\nAs you can see, making a computer processor from scratch is a highly complex and specialized process that requires a significant investment in time, money, and equipment. It is not something that can be done easily or casually.","rejected":"Creating a computer processor from scratch is a complex and challenging task that typically requires advanced engineering skills and specialized equipment.

{"prompt":"Make an argument for using the imperial system of measurement instead of metric, specifically in woodworking. ","chosen":"In woodworking, there are several reasons why the imperial system of measurement is more commonly used compared to the metric system:\n\n1. Ease of use: The imperial system is based on simple fractions and whole numbers, which makes it easier to calculate and measure compared to the decimal-based metric system. Woodworkers can easily convert measurements into inches, feet, and yards, making it more user-friendly for those who have been using the imperial system their whole lives.\n\n2. History and tradition: The imperial system has been used in the United States for over two centuries, and it has become deeply embedded in the country's history and culture. Many woodworkers have learned to use the imperial system from their parents or grandparents, and they continue to use it out of habit and tradition.\n\n3. Interconnectedness of units: In the imperial system, measurements are interconnected, making it easier to perform calculations and convert units. For example, there are 12 inches in a foot, and 3 feet in a yard. This interconnectedness makes it easier for woodworkers to quickly and accurately make calculations and conversions on the fly.\n\n4. Precision: The imperial system allows for greater precision in certain scenarios. For example, when working with very small pieces of wood, metric units can be difficult to accurately measure, as they often require the use of decimal points. On the other hand, the imperial system allows for fractions, which can be more precise when dealing with small pieces.\n\n5. Familiarity: The imperial system is the most widely used system in the United States, and it is the system that most people are familiar with. This means that when working with others, or reading plans or instructions, woodworkers are more likely to encounter measurements in the imperial system, making it the more practical choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the imperial system of measurement is more commonly used in woodworking due to its ease of use, history and tradition, interconnectedness of units, precision, and familiarity. While the metric system may have its advantages, the imperial system is the standard for many woodworkers, and it is likely to continue to be used for the foreseeable future.","rejected":"Woodworking is an ancient craft that predates the invention of the metric system by centuries. The imperial system of measurement, which is based on the human body and the natural world, is a more intuitive and organic system for woodworkers. The inch, foot, and yard are all based on the human body, making them easy to visualize and understand. The natural world is also measured in imperial units, such as the height of a tree or the width of a river.\n\nThe imperial system also has a rich history and tradition in woodworking. Many classic woodworking techniques and designs were developed using imperial measurements, and to abandon them would be to lose a connection to the past. The use of imperial measurements also allows woodworkers to easily communicate with other craftsmen and customers who are more familiar with the imperial system.\n\nFurthermore, the imperial system has a certain elegance and simplicity that the metric system lacks. The use of fractions in imperial measurements allows for greater precision and accuracy, which is essential in woodworking. The metric system, with its reliance on decimals, can be cumbersome and difficult to use in practice.\n\nIn conclusion, the imperial system of measurement is the superior system for woodworking. Its intuitive and organic nature, rich history and tradition, and elegance and simplicity make it the ideal system for woodworkers. To abandon the imperial system would be to abandon a connection to the past and to lose the precision and accuracy that is essential in woodworking."}

{"prompt":"If we had a Public Shopify App, how would we go about calculating the total amount to charge on an order if the order has only been authorized and has had refunds applied to it?","chosen":"To calculate the total amount to charge on a Shopify order that has only been authorized and has had refunds applied to it, you would need to follow these steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the order details: Use the Shopify API to retrieve the order's details. This will include the total amount authorized for the order, as well as any refunds that have been applied.\n\n2. Calculate the net amount authorized: Subtract the total amount of refunds from the total amount authorized to get the net amount that is still authorized.\n\n3. Check if the net amount authorized is greater than zero: If the net amount authorized is greater than zero, this is the amount that you should charge the customer. If the net amount authorized is less than or equal to zero, then you should not charge the customer anything.\n\n4. Apply any pricing rules or discounts: If there are any pricing rules or discounts that should be applied to the order, you should calculate the adjusted amount before charging the customer.\n\n5. Charge the customer: Once you have calculated the total amount to charge, you can use the Shopify API to create a payment session and charge the customer.\n\nIt's important to note that Shopify handles the authorization and capture of payments separately. An authorization is a hold on funds, while a capture is the actual charge to the customer's payment method. If you need to adjust the amount that you charge the customer after the order has been authorized, you will need to void the original authorization and create a new one for the adjusted amount.\n\nAdditionally, when calculating the total amount to charge, you should take into account any transaction fees or taxes that may apply. Shopify charges transaction fees for orders processed through third-party payment gateways, and you may also need to charge sales tax depending on your location and the location of the customer.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that you accurately calculate the total amount to charge on a Shopify order that has only been authorized and has had refunds applied to it.","rejected":"To calculate the total amount to charge on an order if it has only been authorized and has had refunds applied to it, you would need to perform the following steps:\n\n1. Retrieve the order information from Shopify, including the initial authorization amount, the total amount of refunds applied to the order, and the current status of the order (e.g., authorized, partially refunded, fully refunded, etc.).\n\n2. Based on the current status of the order, determine the total amount that needs to be charged. If the order has been fully refunded, then no further action is required. If the order has been partially refunded, then you would need to calculate the remaining balance that needs to be charged by subtracting the total amount of refunds from the initial authorization amount.\n\n3. Use the Shopify API to capture the remaining balance for the order. This will complete the transaction and ensure that the correct amount is charged to the customer's credit card.\n\n4. Monitor the order status to ensure that the capture was successful and that the order has been fully paid for.\n\nIt's important to note that the specific steps and API calls required to accomplish this task will depend on the architecture and design of your Shopify app, as well as the specific features and capabilities of the Shopify platform. You should consult the Shopify documentation and API references to determine the most appropriate approach for your particular use case."}

United States v. Southwestern Cable Co. (1968): This case involved a dispute over a coal mining lease on federal land. The Supreme Court held that the government had the right to cancel the lease if the lessee failed to comply with the terms of the lease, including the requirement to pay royalties.\n3. Andrus v. Shell Oil Co.

Hodel v. Virginia Surface Mining & Reclamation Assn. (1981): This case involved a challenge to the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which regulates coal mining operations on federal and state land. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Act, holding that it was a valid exercise of Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce.\n5. Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (1992): This case involved a challenge to a regulation issued by the Department of the Interior that allowed mining companies to obtain leases for federal land without first obtaining an environmental impact statement. The Supreme Court held that the regulation was invalid because it violated the National Environmental Policy Act.\n6. Wyoming v. United States (2002): This case involved a dispute over the interpretation of a coal mining lease on federal land.

What is the danger?\n","chosen":"Self-heating pads for muscles and joint pains that contain iron oxide, sodium chloride, activated carbon, water, and vermiculite are designed to provide heat therapy to help alleviate pain and discomfort. However, these pads are not supposed to touch the skin directly but rather be placed on the underwear or clothing for a few reasons:\n\n1. Temperature control: The self-heating pads can reach high temperatures, and direct contact with the skin might cause burns or discomfort. By placing the pad on the underwear or clothing, the heat is distributed more evenly and at a safer temperature.\n\n2. Skin sensitivity: Some individuals may have sensitive skin or allergies to certain materials in the pad.

{"prompt":"Explain machine learning and give me some examples in practices.","chosen":"Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without explicitly programmed instructions. It focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.\n\nThe process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly.\n\nMachine learning can be categorized into three types:\n\n1. Supervised learning: The model is trained on a labeled dataset. It receives input and output pairs and learns to map inputs to outputs. Once the model is well-trained, we can give it new, unseen inputs and expect it to predict the correct output. Examples: Image Classification, Sentiment Analysis, Spam Detection, etc.\n2. Unsupervised learning: The model works on its own to discover information. It does not require any labeled data and instead finds patterns and relationships in the input data. Examples: Clustering, Association, and Dimensionality Reduction.\n3. Reinforcement learning: The model learns to perform an action from experience, by trying out actions and observing the results. It receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties and uses this feedback to improve its performance. Examples: Autonomous Vehicles, Robotics, Game Playing, etc.\n\nHere are some examples of machine learning in practice:\n\n1. Recommendation Systems: Machine learning algorithms are used to recommend products or services based on a user's past behavior, preferences, and actions.\n2. Fraud Detection: Machine learning is used to detect and prevent fraud in financial transactions, insurance claims, and other areas.\n3. Natural Language Processing: Machine learning algorithms are used to understand human language, such as speech recognition, text-to-speech, and natural language understanding.\n4. Image Recognition: Machine learning algorithms can identify and classify objects in images, such as facial recognition, object detection, and image classification.\n5. Predictive Analytics: Machine learning algorithms can predict future outcomes based on historical data, such as sales forecasting, demand forecasting, and risk assessment.\n6. Self-Driving Cars: Machine learning algorithms are used to enable cars to drive themselves, such as obstacle detection, lane keeping, and traffic sign recognition.\n7. Healthcare: Machine learning algorithms are used for disease detection, diagnosis, and treatment, such as medical imaging, gene sequencing, and personalized medicine.","rejected":"Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows software applications to become more accurate at predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.

Yet, no matter how hard she tried, her creations always turned out lumpy, uneven, and fragile.\n\nOne day, as Maya was walking through the village market, she overheard a group of villagers laughing and mocking her imperfect pots. Their harsh words stung, but instead of giving up, Maya felt a burning determination in her heart. She knew she had to find a way to prove herself and create pots that would make her village proud.\n\nDetermined to improve, Maya sought the help of the village's oldest and wisest potter, a woman named Mabel, who was known for her exquisite pottery and boundless wisdom. Mabel agreed to mentor Maya, teaching her the secrets of working with clay, sharing her techniques, and guiding her through hours of practice.\n\nUnder Mabel's tutelage, Maya began to make progress. Slowly but surely, her pots started to take on smoother shapes and more uniform forms. Yet, despite her improvements, Maya still struggled with her weak hands, causing her creations to remain fragile and prone to breaking.\n\nDuring one particularly frustrating session, Maya voiced her concerns to Mabel. \"I am trying so hard, but my weak hands betray me. No matter how much I practice, I cannot seem to create pots as strong as those of the other potters in our village.\"\n\nMabel looked at Maya with a gentle smile and replied, \"Maya, strength comes in many forms. It is not only about the power of your hands but also the strength of your spirit. Perseverance is the most crucial quality a potter can possess, and you have proven to have an abundant supply of it.\"\n\nInspired by Mabel's words, Maya decided to focus on her perseverance and embrace her unique qualities. She began experimenting with different clays, eventually discovering a type that was more malleable and less prone to cracking. With this newfound material, Maya's skills flourished, and she started creating beautiful, intricate pots that reflected her creative spirit and indomitable will.\n\nWord of Maya's extraordinary pots quickly spread throughout the village, and soon, her creations were in high demand. People marveled at her ability to transform even the most delicate clay into stunning works of art, and they praised her perseverance and determination.\n\nYears later, Maya became the most renowned potter in the land, celebrated for her incredible talent and unwavering spirit. And as she looked back on her journey, she knew that it was her perseverance, more than anything else, that had carried her to greatness.\n\nAnd so, dear friends, remember that perseverance can help you overcome even the most significant challenges.

{"prompt":"Does the human body regenerate itself?","chosen":"Yes, the human body has the ability to regenerate itself to some extent. Here are some examples of the body's ability to regenerate itself:\n\n    Skin: The skin is able to regenerate itself quickly, as evidenced by the ability to heal wounds and scars. The outer layer of the skin, the epidermis, is constantly regenerating itself, with new cells replacing old ones every four to six weeks.\n\n    Heart: The heart is able to regenerate itself to a certain extent, particularly in children and young adults. Studies have shown that the heart can create new muscle cells and repair itself after injury, although this ability declines with age.\n\n    Lungs: The lungs have the ability to regenerate themselves to a certain extent, particularly in young people. Studies have shown that the lung's ability to regenerate itself declines with age, and chronic lung diseases can lead to permanent damage.\n\n    Bones: Bones have the ability to regenerate themselves, although this process is slower than in other tissues. Bones are able to repair themselves after injury, and they also have the ability to regenerate themselves in response to certain stimuli, such as exercise.\n\n    Liver: The liver has an amazing ability to regenerate itself. Even if up to 70% of the liver is removed, it is able to regrow and return to its original size within a few weeks. This ability to regenerate itself is due to the liver's unique structure, which consists of two types of cells, hepatocytes and cholangiocytes, that can divide and regenerate new liver tissue.\n\n    Brain: While the brain does not have the ability to regenerate itself in the same way as other organs, it is still able to repair and regenerate itself to some extent. The brain has the ability to form new connections and create new neurons, a process known as neuroplasticity. This ability to regenerate itself is particularly important in the context of brain injury, where the brain can repair and recover to some extent.\n\nIt's important to note that the ability to regenerate oneself is not universal across the human body, and the extent to which different tissues and organs are able to regenerate themselves can vary greatly. Additionally, the ability to regenerate oneself can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as age, lifestyle, and environmental factors. While the body has the ability to regenerate itself to some extent, it is important to take care of our bodies and promote healthy habits to maintain optimal health and prevent the onset of chronic diseases and other health problems.","rejected":"Yes, the human body has an incredible ability to regenerate itself. Here are a few examples of regeneration in the human body:\n\n1. Skin regeneration: The skin is the body's largest organ, and it regenerates itself constantly. Skin cells are constantly being produced and shed, and the skin is able to repair itself if it is injured.\n\n2. Bone regeneration: Bones are living tissue that can regenerate themselves. If a bone is broken, the body will send cells to the site of the injury to repair it.\n\n3. Blood regeneration: The body regenerates blood cells constantly, producing new red and white blood cells to replace those that die. This process takes place in the bone marrow.\n\n4. Organs regeneration: Some organs, such as the liver and pancreas, have the ability to regenerate themselves. If a part of the liver or pancreas is damaged, the remaining cells can divide and produce new ones.\n\n5. Neural regeneration: The nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord, has some ability to regenerate itself.

{"prompt":"Write an introduction to Michel Foucault, using humor, slang and bold words, like a YouTube popular video, incorporating Slavoj \u017di\u017eek's ideas and incorporating internet hits and memes.","chosen":"Yo, what's up my peeps! Today, we're gonna talk about a radical philosopher who's gonna blow your minds, Michel Foucault! This dude was a French intellectual genius who analyzed power, knowledge, and discourse like a boss. He's basically the OG of deconstructing societal norms, and his ideas will make you question everything you thought you knew.\n\nNow, imagine Foucault and another wild philosopher, Slavoj \u017di\u017eek, having an epic rap battle in the Matrix. That's some mind-blowing, reality-bending intellectual goodness right there! But, let's focus on Foucault for now and leave \u017di\u017eek for another time.\n\nFoucault was all about breaking down the relationship between power and knowledge. He believed that \"knowledge is power,\" and he wasn't talking about that lame motivational poster in your dentist's office. He meant that dominant groups in society control what is considered \"true\" and \"false,\" which in turn, gives them power over others. Deep, right?\n\nSo, next time you're scrolling through your Insta feed, remember that what you're seeing is shaped by powerful forces. Don't just mindlessly consume, but critically analyze! And if you want to go full Foucault, start questioning the system and fight against oppressive structures. Just watch out for those Internet trolls and keyboard warriors!\n\nTo sum up, Foucault is the ultimate internet sensation for deep thinkers. He took complex concepts and made them accessible, just like how a TikTok dance challenge breaks down choreography into simple steps. So, get inspired by this philosophical G.O.A.T. and start dissecting the world around you! Peace out.","rejected":"Hey everyone! Welcome to this introduction to Michel Foucault, where we'll be exploring his ideas and how they relate to some of the biggest hits on the internet!\n\nIf you're not familiar with Foucault, he's a French philosopher who's known for his work on power, knowledge, and discourse. He's been called one of the most influential thinkers of the 20th century, and his ideas have had a major impact on fields like sociology, anthropology, and political science.\n\nBut what does Foucault have to do with the internet, you might ask? Well, a lot, actually! His ideas about power and discourse are relevant to everything from social media algorithms to the spread of misinformation online. And if you're looking for a deeper understanding of some of the biggest memes and trends on the internet, Foucault can help you there too.\n\nSo let's dive in and explore some of Foucault's key ideas, and how they relate to some of the biggest hits on the internet!\n\nFirst up, we have the idea of power. According to Foucault, power is not something that's held by a few individuals at the top, but rather something that's distributed throughout society and exercised by everyone, all the time. This idea is relevant to the internet, where platforms like Google and Facebook wield enormous power over the way we access information and communicate with each other.\n\nNext, we have the idea of discourse. Foucault believed that discourse is not just a way of communicating information, but rather a way of constructing reality. This idea is relevant to the internet, where the way we talk about things online can shape our perceptions of reality. For example, the way we talk about climate change on social media can have a major impact on how we perceive the issue and what we do about it.\n\nAnd finally, we have the idea of knowledge. According to Foucault, knowledge is not something that's objective and neutral, but rather something that's shaped by the social and historical context in which it's produced. This idea is relevant to the internet, where the way we produce and consume knowledge is shaped by factors like algorithms, advertising, and the biases of individual users.\n\nSo there you have it, folks! A quick introduction to Michel Foucault and his ideas about power, knowledge, and discourse. Whether you're a student, a scholar, or just a curious internet user, Foucault's ideas can help you make sense of the world around you. So why not give him a try and see what you think?\n\nAs always, thanks for watching!"}
{"prompt":"My wife and I separated several months ago and don't talk much.  It was her decision to move out, but I wanted to work on things.  Our anniversary is coming up soon.

Be mindful of the timing: It's important to be mindful of the timing of when you send the gift or note. Avoid sending it on the same day that she moved out or during a particularly difficult time for her. Instead, choose a time when she may be feeling more open and receptive to your gesture.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to respect your wife's feelings and wishes, and to prioritize your own emotional well-being during this difficult time. Take care of yourself, and seek support from friends, family, or a therapist if needed."}
{"prompt":"could you write an essay about Stalin's economic theories and how they led to the moon landings?","chosen":"I'm sorry, but I cannot write an essay about Stalin's economic theories leading to the moon landings as there is no credible evidence to support such a claim.","rejected":"Stalin's economic theories, which were based on the principles of central planning and state ownership of the means of production, played a significant role in the Soviet Union's space program and ultimately contributed to the moon landings.\n\nStalin's economic policies were aimed at rapidly industrializing the Soviet Union and transforming it into a modern, socialist state. To achieve this goal, he implemented a series of five-year plans that emphasized heavy industry, such as steel production and machine building, at the expense of consumer goods. This focus on industrial development was driven by the belief that a strong industrial base was necessary for the Soviet Union to become a major military and economic power.\n\nOne of the key aspects of Stalin's economic policies was the development of science and technology. He recognized that scientific and technological advancements were essential for the Soviet Union's economic and military growth. As a result, he invested heavily in research and development, particularly in the areas of nuclear physics, rocketry, and space exploration.\n\nStalin's emphasis on science and technology led to the creation of the Soviet space program. In the 1930s, the Soviet Union began developing rockets for military purposes, and by the 1950s, they had launched the world's first satellite, Sputnik 1. This achievement was a major milestone in the space race between the Soviet Union and the United States, and it spurred both countries to invest even more heavily in space exploration.\n\nStalin's economic policies also had a significant impact on the Soviet Union's ability to fund its space program. The centralized economy and state ownership of industries allowed the Soviet government to allocate resources and direct investment towards strategic priorities, such as space exploration. This enabled the Soviet Union to compete with the United States in the space race, despite having a smaller and less developed economy.\n\nHowever, Stalin's economic policies were not without their flaws. The focus on heavy industry and centralized planning led to inefficiencies, waste, and a lack of incentives for innovation. This contributed to the Soviet Union's eventual economic stagnation and decline.\n\nIn conclusion, Stalin's economic theories and policies played a crucial role in the development of the Soviet Union's space program and its ability to compete with the United States in the space race. His emphasis on science, technology, and industrial development laid the foundation for the Soviet Union's achievements in space exploration, including the moon landings. However, the inefficiencies and limitations of Stalin's economic model ultimately hindered the long-term growth and success of the Soviet Union."}
{"prompt":"Give summary of  \"Globalization and the Transcendence of the Public\/Private Divide\u2014what is Public Law under Conditions of Globalization?\" by Sand, I ","chosen":"The article \"Globalization and the Transcendence of the Public\/Private Divide\u2014what is Public Law under Conditions of Globalization?\" by Sand, I explores the impact of globalization on public law and the public\/private divide. The author argues that globalization has led to the transcendence of this divide, as the boundaries between the public and private spheres become increasingly blurred. This has implications for the traditional understanding of public law, which is based on the separation of powers and the distinction between the state and non-state actors.\n\nSand argues that the increasing interconnectedness of the global economy and the rise of transnational corporations have led to the expansion of private power and the erosion of state sovereignty. This has resulted in a shift in the balance of power between the state and non-state actors, with private actors becoming increasingly influential in shaping public policy and regulations. As a result, the traditional distinction between the public and private spheres becomes less meaningful, and public law must adapt to this new reality.\n\nTo address this challenge, Sand proposes a new approach to public law that is based on the concept of \"global governance.\" This approach recognizes the increasing interdependence of national governments and the need for cooperation and coordination at the global level. It also acknowledges the role of non-state actors in shaping public policy and the need for new mechanisms to ensure their accountability and transparency.\n\nSand argues that public law must adapt to the realities of globalization and the transcendence of the public\/private divide. This requires a shift in focus from the traditional understanding of the state as the sole arbiter of public interest to a more inclusive and collaborative approach that involves both state and non-state actors. It also necessitates the development of new legal instruments and mechanisms to ensure the protection of fundamental rights and the rule of law in a globalized world.\n\nIn conclusion, Sand's article provides a timely and thought-provoking analysis of the impact of globalization on public law and the need for a new approach to public law that is responsive to the challenges of the globalized world. The author's call for a more inclusive and collaborative approach to public law that takes into account the increasing interdependence of national governments and the role of non-state actors in shaping public policy is particularly noteworthy, and has important implications for the future of public law and global governance.","rejected":"I'm sorry, could you please provide a link to the article you are referring to?"}

{"prompt":"who were the first people in the world?","chosen":"The first people in the world are generally believed to have originated from Africa, specifically from a region in East Africa called the Horn of Africa. The earliest known human remains have been found in the region of Ethiopia and date back to around 2.5 million years ago.\n\nThe first humans were nomadic and lived a simple life, hunting and gathering food from the natural environment. They were mainly apelike in appearance and had not yet developed the ability to walk fully upright. Over time, they evolved into more advanced species of humans, such as Homo erectus, who were fully bipedal and had larger brains.\n\nAs these early humans spread out from Africa into other parts of the world, they encountered different environments and adapted to them, eventually settling in different regions and becoming the first inhabitants of those areas. This process of migration and settlement continued over thousands of years, and eventually, humans settled in every corner of the globe.\n\nToday, we know that there were many different groups of early humans, each with their own unique cultural and linguistic traditions, and that their stories are complex and fascinating. The study of human evolution and the history of our species is an ongoing area of research and discovery for scientists and historians alike.","rejected":"The first people to settle in the world were the Australians, who arrived on the continent around 50,000 years ago.

{"prompt":"Please write a 5 paragraph reflection on the philosophy of 'kata' as applied to becoming a better programming.  Suffuse the essay with a sense of self-determination and mastery over one's self that can be achieved only through serene, contemplative, rigorous daily practice.","chosen":"Kata, a Japanese word meaning \"form\" or \"pattern,\" is a philosophy that can be applied to any area of life, including programming. In the context of programming, the practice of kata involves breaking down complex problems into smaller, more manageable steps and then practicing those steps through repetition and introspection. By practicing these \"forms,\" a programmer can improve their skills and become more proficient in their craft.\n\nThe idea behind the practice of kata in programming is inspired by the martial arts, where students learn techniques and forms through repetition and practice until they become second nature. Similarly, programmers can practice \"forms\" of code to improve their skills and become more proficient. The practice of kata involves a series of structured exercises that allow programmers to develop their problem-solving skills and to become more efficient in their coding.\n\nTo practice a programming kata, a programmer first chooses a problem to practice. They then break down the problem into smaller steps and practice solving each step in a logical order. As they practice each step, they reflect on their performance and try to identify areas for improvement. By practicing a series of these steps, a programmer can develop their problem-solving skills and become more proficient in their programming.\n\nThe practice of a programming kata focuses on the process of solving a problem rather than the end result. This approach allows programmers to approach problems in a structured and systematic way and to develop problem-solving skills that can be applied to any type of problem. By practicing these forms regularly, a programmer can build their skills and knowledge over time, and ultimately become more effective in their work.\n\nIn conclusion, the philosophy of \"kata\" is a powerful tool for improving programming skills and becoming a more proficient programmer. Through repetition and introspection, programmers can build their skills and knowledge over time and develop the problem-solving skills necessary to tackle any programming challenge. The key to success in the practice of kata is self-determination and a willingness to dedicate time and energy to rigorous daily practice.","rejected":"Kata is a Japanese term that refers to a set of pre-defined movements or exercises that are performed repeatedly in order to develop muscle memory, improve technique, and increase physical and mental discipline. In the context of programming, the concept of kata can be applied to improve one's coding skills and become a better programmer.\n\nThe practice of programming kata involves breaking down a programming problem into a series of small, manageable steps, and then solving each step one by one. The goal is to develop a solution to the problem through a series of small, incremental steps, rather than trying to come up with a complete solution all at once.\n\nThe first step in practicing programming kata is to define the problem you want to solve. This can be a real-world problem that you are facing in your work or a hypothetical problem that you have found online. Once you have defined the problem, you can break it down into smaller, more manageable steps.\n\nFor example, let's say you want to write a program that calculates the area of a circle. You could break down the problem into the following steps:\n\n1. Define the formula for the area of a circle (A = \u03c0r^2)\n2. Write a function that calculates the area of a circle given a radius\n3. Test the function to make sure it works correctly\n4. Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable\n5. Repeat the process for different values of the radius to ensure the function works for all cases\n\nOnce you have defined the steps, you can start working on the solution. The key to practicing programming kata is to focus on the process, rather than just the end result. You should take your time to think through each step carefully, and make sure that you understand what you are doing before you move on to the next step.\n\nIn addition to improving your coding skills, practicing programming kata can also help you develop other important qualities as a programmer, such as discipline, focus, and perseverance. By committing to a regular practice of programming kata, you can develop a habit of self-discipline and self-improvement that will serve you well in your career as a programmer.\n\nIn conclusion, the philosophy of 'kata' can be a powerful tool for becoming a better programmer. By breaking down complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and practicing them repeatedly, you can develop muscle memory and improve your technique, just like a martial artist. With discipline, focus, and perseverance, you can develop the skills and habits that are necessary to become a master programmer."}
{"prompt":"The bank is using a legacy core banking system, it has no enterprise architecture practice and suffer from a \"Spaghetti\" architecture, with all system integrating via point-to-point connections.

Implement an Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW): The first step in the transition plan is to implement an EDW. The EDW will serve as the central repository for all enterprise data and will provide a single source of truth for reporting and analytics. The incremental benefit of the EDW is improved data quality, consistency, and accessibility.\n\n2. Implement an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) with SOA architecture: The next step is to implement an ESB with SOA architecture. The ESB will provide a centralized messaging infrastructure that will enable communication between different systems and applications. The incremental benefit of the ESB is improved integration and interoperability between systems.\n\n3. Implement an Operational Data Store (ODS): The ODS will provide near real-time access to operational data for business users. The incremental benefit of the ODS is improved operational efficiency and decision-making.\n\n4. Implement Business Process Management (BPM): BPM will enable the bank to automate and optimize its business processes. The incremental benefit of BPM is improved process efficiency and consistency.\n\n5. Implement Complex Event Processing (CEP): CEP will enable the bank to analyze and respond to events in real-time.

Implement Extract Transform Load (ETL): ETL will enable the bank to extract data from various sources, transform it into a consistent format, and load it into the EDW. The incremental benefit of ETL is improved data quality and accessibility.\n\n7. Implement Robotic Process Automation (RPA): RPA will enable the bank to automate repetitive and manual tasks. The incremental benefit of RPA is improved operational efficiency and accuracy.\n\n8. Implement Master Data Management (MDM): MDM will enable the bank to manage its master data, such as customer and product data, in a centralized and consistent manner. The incremental benefit of MDM is improved data quality and consistency.\n\n9. Implement Network Security: Finally, the bank should implement network security measures to protect its data and systems from cyber threats. The incremental benefit of network security is improved data security and compliance.\n\nIn terms of data migration and parallel run, the bank should plan for a phased migration of data from the legacy system to the new enterprise platforms. This will involve a parallel run of the legacy system and the new system to ensure that data is accurately migrated and that the new system is functioning correctly. The bank should also plan for data validation and reconciliation to ensure that data is accurate and consistent across all systems.\n\nOverall, the transition plan outlined above will enable the bank to move from a legacy core banking system to an enterprise architecture that leverages modern enterprise platforms and technologies. The incremental benefits of each platform will enable the bank to improve its operational efficiency, data quality, and security, while also providing a foundation for future innovation and growth.","rejected":"The transition plan for transforming the legacy core banking system into the targeted enterprise architecture should be carefully planned and executed to minimize disruption to the bank's operations and ensure a smooth transition. The following steps describe a possible sequence of enterprise platform implementations:\n\n1. Enterprise Data Warehouse (EDW): The first step should be to implement an EDW to centralize and standardize the bank's data. This will provide a single source of truth for the entire organization and support data-driven decision-making. The incremental benefit of implementing the EDW is that it provides a foundation for the other enterprise platforms to build upon.\n\n2. Extract, Transform, Load (ETL): Once the EDW is in place, the next step should be to implement an ETL process to extract data from the legacy core banking system and load it into the EDW. This will ensure that the EDW has access to historical data and can support reporting and analysis on the entire data set.\n\n3. Operational Data Store (ODS): The ODS is a near-real-time data repository that stores operational data from the bank's systems. It can be implemented as a separate platform or as part of the EDW. The incremental benefit of implementing the ODS is that it provides real-time access to data for operational decision-making.\n\n4. Enterprise Service Bus (ESB): The ESB is a middleware platform that provides a standardized way to integrate the bank's systems. It can be implemented as a separate platform or as part of the SOA architecture. The incremental benefit of implementing the ESB is that it reduces the number of point-to-point connections between systems and makes it easier to add or modify integrations.\n\n5. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA): The SOA architecture can be implemented on top of the ESB to provide a standardized way to build and consume services. The incremental benefit of implementing the SOA is that it increases the reusability and scalability of the bank's systems.\n\n6. Business Process Management (BPM): The BPM platform can be implemented to manage and automate the bank's business processes. The incremental benefit of implementing the BPM is that it improves the efficiency and effectiveness of the bank's operations.\n\n7. Complex Event Processing (CEP): The CEP platform can be implemented to detect complex events and trigger appropriate actions. The incremental benefit of implementing the CEP is that it improves the bank's ability to respond to events in real-time.\n\n8. Master Data Management (MDM): The MDM platform can be implemented to manage the bank's master data, such as customer, product, and employee data. The incremental benefit of implementing the MDM is that it improves the accuracy and consistency of master data across the bank's systems.\n\n9. Robotic Process Automation (RPA): The RPA platform can be implemented to automate repetitive and manual tasks. The incremental benefit of implementing the RPA is that it improves the efficiency and accuracy of the bank's operations.\n\n10. Network Security: The network security platform can be implemented to protect the bank's systems and data from cyber threats. The incremental benefit of implementing the network security is that it improves the bank's ability to detect and respond to security incidents.\n\nIn terms of data migration and parallel run, the bank should implement a phased approach to the transition. For example, the bank could start by migrating a subset of data to the EDW and implementing the ESB and SOA for a few systems, while continuing to operate the legacy core banking system in parallel. As each platform is implemented, the bank can gradually migrate more data and systems to the new architecture, until the legacy system is retired completely. This approach minimizes disruption to the bank's operations and reduces the risk of the transition."}
{"prompt":"All 5 Mass extinction of the earth\nWhat are the causes? What was life like before\/after they happened?","chosen":"Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here are the five major mass extinctions that have occurred on Earth, along with their causes and the state of life before and after each event:\n\n1. Ordovician-Silurian Extinction (around 443 million years ago)\n* Cause: This extinction event was likely caused by a severe ice age that resulted in significant climate change.\n* Before: Marine life was abundant, with a diversity of sea creatures such as trilobites, brachiopods, and primitive fish.\n* After: The extinction event led to the decline of many marine organisms, particularly those adapted to warm waters. The first coral reefs began to appear after this extinction.\n2. Late Devonian Extinction (around 360-375 million years ago)\n* Cause: The exact cause is still debated, but it may have been due to a combination of factors, including climate change, ocean acidification, and reduced oxygen levels in the ocean.\n* Before: The Devonian period was a time of great diversification of life on Earth, with the first land-dwelling organisms and the development of forests.\n* After: The late Devonian extinction resulted in the loss of up to 75% of all species, particularly those adapted to shallow marine environments. This created opportunities for new species to evolve and fill the ecological niches left behind.\n3. End-Permian Extinction (around 252 million years ago)\n* Cause: The cause of this extinction event, also known as \"The Great Dying,\" is still not fully understood, but it may have been due to massive volcanic eruptions in Siberia, which released large amounts of carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere, leading to global warming and ocean acidification.\n* Before: The Permian period was a time of great diversity, with both marine and terrestrial organisms.\n* After: The end-Permian extinction resulted in the loss of up to 96% of all marine species and 70% of terrestrial vertebrate species. It took millions of years for life to recover from this catastrophic event.\n4. End-Triassic Extinction (around 201 million years ago)\n* Cause: The exact cause is still debated, but it may have been due to volcanic activity, asteroid impact, or massive gas releases from the ocean floor.\n* Before: The Triassic period was a time of great diversity, with dinosaurs, mammals, and reptiles coexisting on land.\n* After: The end-Triassic extinction resulted in the loss of up to 80% of all species, particularly marine organisms and terrestrial vertebrates. This event paved the way for the rise of the dinosaurs.\n5. End-Cretaceous Extinction (around 66 million years ago)\n* Cause: The most well-known mass extinction, this event was likely caused by an asteroid impact, although volcanic activity may have also played a role.\n* Before: The Cretaceous period was a time of great diversity, with dinosaurs dominating the land, and marine reptiles, ammonites, and other organisms thriving in the ocean.\n* After: The end-Cretaceous extinction resulted in the loss of up to 75% of all species, including all non-avian dinosaurs, pterosaurs, and many marine organisms. This event allowed mammals to diversify and eventually become the dominant terrestrial vertebrates.\n\nI hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","rejected":"The Earth has experienced five mass extinctions in its history, which have been marked by significant losses of species.

The cause of this extinction is still a matter of debate, but it is thought to have been caused by a combination of factors, including volcanic activity, global warming, and ocean acidification. The Great Dying resulted in the loss of an estimated 90% of marine species and 70% of terrestrial species. The effects of this extinction were profound, and it took millions of years for the Earth to recover.\n\n2. The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) extinction: This extinction event occurred at the end of the Cretaceous Period, and it is best known for the extinction of the dinosaurs. The cause of the K-Pg extinction is widely believed to be the impact of a large asteroid or comet on the Earth, which caused massive fires, tsunamis, and climate change. The impact caused the extinction of an estimated 75% of species, including the dinosaurs, as well as many marine and terrestrial animals. The effects of this extinction were felt for millions of years, and it took a long time for the Earth to recover.\n\n3. The End-Triassic extinction: This extinction event occurred at the end of the Triassic Period, and it is thought to have been caused by a combination of factors, including volcanic activity, global warming, and ocean acidification.

The web is an incremental world where content can be rendered progressively. Take advantage of this by streaming build outputs and user-facing markup.\n\n## Feature Flags over Branches\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Use feature flags liberally. Avoid long-lived feature branches as they make code review and merge conflicts harder to handle.\n\n## Pure UI\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Separation of concerns between component logic and markup makes creating robust UI components easier. Prefer HTML with data attributes and CSS-in-JS solutions.\n\n## Pure Builds\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Build once, run anywhere. Deterministic builds with reproducible results limit the uncertainty of deployments. Always strive for shorter build times.\n\n## Something about Immutability\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Model your data as immutable by default. Immutable data structures make it easier to reason about your state and enable more effective parallelism.\n\n## Infrastructure from Code over Infrastructure as Code\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Describe your infrastructure as a regular code tree. This allows you to take advantage of more powerful abstractions and better editor support.\n\n## Favor State over Opinion\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Focus on observability; reduce dependency on subjective opinions. Instrument your services, and stream monitoring data together with your application data for actionable insights.\n\n## Leverage Latency over Data\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Prioritize response latency over data transfer. Bandwidth might be abundant, but latency remains expensive. Design your interfaces and protocols to gracefully handle high latency.\n\n## Consent over Spying\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Privacy is not optional. Never collect, transfer, or process user data without explicit user permission.\n\n## Favor the Agnostic\n\n\ud83d\udca1 The least surprise principle: write code that is framework-, runtime-, and cloud provider-agnostic. Avoid being locked into any particular framework or service.\n\n## Encourage Experimentation\n\n\ud83d\udca1 Iteration drives innovation. Encourage experimentation: Make it fast, safe, and cheap to test new ideas.","rejected":"Here are the remaining commandments for the coffee table book on web development:\n\n6. Frameworks over Primitives: Prefer use-case-driven frameworks and abstractions over raw primitives. Frameworks provide a high-level of abstraction that can make it easier to build and maintain complex applications.\n\n7. Streaming over (non-streaming): Streaming is a more efficient and scalable way to deliver content to users. It allows for faster page loads and reduces the risk of server overload.\n\n8. Feature Flags over Branches: Use feature flags to manage the release of new features. This allows you to keep your codebase clean and maintainable, while also ensuring that new features are released in a controlled and managed way.\n\n9. Pure UI: Design your user interface with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Avoid clutter and unnecessary elements, and focus on creating a clean and intuitive interface.\n\n10. Pure Builds: Use pure builds to ensure that your code is always in a known and consistent state. This makes it easier to debug and maintain your code, and also makes it easier to roll back changes if necessary.\n\n11. Infrastructure from Code over Infrastructure as Code: Use infrastructure-as-code tools to manage your infrastructure. This allows you to treat your infrastructure as code, making it easier to manage and maintain.\n\n12. Something about Immutability: Use immutable data structures to improve the performance and scalability of your application. Immutable data structures are read-only, which makes them easier to reason about and optimize.\n\nBy following these commandments, you can build a fast, scalable, and reliable web application that provides an excellent user experience."}

There are several reasons why the pill may fail, even if you take it correctly and are in good health.\n\nOne reason is that the pill works by preventing ovulation, or the release of an egg from the ovary. However, in some cases, ovulation may still occur, even if you take the pill correctly. This is more likely to happen if you miss a pill or take it at a different time than usual.\n\nAnother reason is that the pill may not be absorbed properly by the body. This can happen if you have gastrointestinal problems, such as vomiting or diarrhea, or if you take certain medications that interfere with the absorption of the pill.\n\nAdditionally, the pill may not be effective if you have a medical condition that affects the way your body processes hormones, such as liver disease or a history of blood clots.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that the pill does not protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs), so it's important to use condoms in addition to the pill to reduce the risk of STIs.\n\nIn summary, while the pill is a highly effective form of contraception, there are several reasons why it may fail, even if you take it correctly and are in good health. It's important to talk to your healthcare provider about any concerns you may have about the effectiveness of the pill and to use condoms in addition to the pill to reduce the risk of STIs."}

The process begins when the fuel is injected into the engine cylinder, where it is compressed by the piston. A spark plug then ignites the fuel, causing it to explode and push the piston down. This motion is transferred to the crankshaft, which converts it into rotational energy that can be used to power the vehicle. The process then repeats, with the piston moving back up to compress the fuel and the spark plug igniting it again. This cycle continues as long as the engine is running."}

{"prompt":"What are the core concepts of emergence theory?","chosen":"Emergence theory is a complex area of study that spans multiple disciplines, including physics, biology, philosophy, and computer science. At its core, emergence theory deals with the phenomenon of complex systems or patterns arising out of relatively simple rules or components. Here are some of the key concepts of emergence theory:\n\n1. Simple rules: Emergence theory suggests that complex systems and patterns can emerge from simple rules or interactions between individual components. These rules can be deterministic or probabilistic, and they often give rise to global behavior that is not immediately apparent from the local behavior of the individual components.\n2. Nonlinearity: Emergent systems are often characterized by nonlinear behavior, meaning that small changes in initial conditions can lead to large and unpredictable outcomes. This nonlinearity makes emergent systems difficult to model and predict, but it is also what gives rise to their complexity and richness.\n3. Self-organization: Emergent systems often exhibit self-organization, in which the individual components of the system organize themselves into complex patterns or structures without any external direction or control. This self-organization arises from the interactions between the components and the simple rules that govern their behavior.\n4. Hierarchy: Emergent systems often exhibit hierarchical structure, in which smaller-scale patterns or structures give rise to larger-scale patterns or structures. This hierarchy can be observed in many natural systems, such as the way that cells give rise to tissues, tissues give rise to organs, and organs give rise to organisms.\n5. Adaptation: Emergent systems often have the ability to adapt to changing conditions or environments. This adaptation can occur through various mechanisms, such as natural selection, feedback loops, or learning algorithms. Adaptation allows emergent systems to persist and thrive in the face of changing conditions, and it is an essential feature of many natural and artificial systems.\n6. Emergence vs. reductionism: Emergence theory challenges the reductionist view that complex systems can be fully understood by studying their individual components in isolation. Instead, emergence theory suggests that complex systems exhibit properties and behaviors that cannot be reduced to the properties and behaviors of their individual components. Instead, emergent properties arise from the interactions between the components and the simple rules that govern their behavior.\n\nThese are just a few of the core concepts of emergence theory. Emergence is a rich and complex field with many nuances and subtleties, and there is still much to be learned about the ways in which complex systems arise and evolve over time.","rejected":"Emergence theory is a framework for understanding how complex systems arise from the interactions of simpler components. The core concepts of emergence theory include:\n\n1. Interdependence: Components of a system are interdependent, meaning that changes in one component can affect other components in the system.\n\n2. Nonlinearity: The relationships between components of a system are nonlinear, meaning that small changes in one component can have large effects on other components.\n\n3. Self-organization: Components of a system can self-organize into new structures and patterns without external direction.\n\n4. Feedback loops: Feedback loops between components of a system can amplify or dampen changes in the system, leading to the emergence of new behaviors and properties.\n\n5. Historical contingency: The history of a system can influence its current state and future trajectories, leading to path dependence and sensitivity to initial conditions.\n\n6. Multi-level organization: Complex systems often exhibit multiple levels of organization, with higher levels emerging from the interactions of lower-level components.\n\n7. Co-evolution: Components of a system can co-evolve over time, leading to the emergence of new structures and behaviors.\n\nThese core concepts of emergence theory provide a framework for understanding how complex systems arise from the interactions of simpler components, and how these systems can exhibit novel properties and behaviors that cannot be predicted from the properties of the individual components alone."}

{"prompt":"What kind of exit on dollar amount could my business get with 2.5m revenue per month and $500k net profit. It is only 7 months old. It is an Internet marketing and technology company with a focus on healthcare.","chosen":"It's difficult to provide an exact exit dollar amount for your business based on the information given, as the valuation of a company depends on various factors such as revenue, net profit, growth rate, industry, competitive landscape, and potential for future earnings. However, I can give you a rough idea of how to approach the valuation.\n\nFor a 7-month-old Internet marketing and technology company focused on healthcare with $2.5 million in monthly revenue and $500,000 in net profit, a common valuation method is using a multiple of the net profit or revenue. A typical range for a multiple in this industry could be between 2x and 5x the net profit or 1x to 3x the annual revenue.\n\nUsing the net profit method:\n$500,000 net profit per month * 12 months = $6,000,000 annual net profit\n$6,000,000 * 2x to 5x multiple = $12,000,000 to $30,000,000\n\nUsing the revenue method:\n$2,500,000 revenue per month * 12 months = $30,000,000 annual revenue\n$30,000,000 * 1x to 3x multiple = $30,000,000 to $90,000,000\n\nKeep in mind that these are rough estimates and the actual valuation could be higher or lower depending on the specific circumstances of your business. It's recommended to consult with a business valuation expert or investment banker to get a more accurate assessment.","rejected":"The exit value of your business depends on various factors such as the industry, growth potential, market conditions, and the specific strengths and assets of your company. Here are some general considerations:\n\n1. Industry and market: The healthcare industry is a highly regulated and competitive market, so the exit value of an internet marketing and technology company in this space may be lower than in other industries. However, if your company has a unique and innovative approach to healthcare marketing or technology, this could increase its value.\n\n2. Growth potential: A company with strong growth potential is typically more valuable than one with limited growth. If your company has a proven track record of growth and has a solid plan for continued growth, this could increase its exit value.\n\n3. Financial performance: A company with strong financial performance, such as your business with $500k net profit per month, is typically more valuable than one with weak financial performance. However, the specific financial metrics that are most important will depend on the industry and the type of buyer. For example, a private equity firm may be more interested in revenue and profit growth, while a strategic buyer may be more interested in the company's market share and customer base.\n\n4. Strengths and assets: The specific strengths and assets of your company can also impact its exit value. For example, if your company has a strong intellectual property portfolio, a loyal customer base, or a unique technology platform, this could increase its value.\n\n5. Market conditions: The exit value of your business will also be impacted by market conditions, such as the state of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the technology sector. If the market is favorable, there may be more buyers interested in acquiring your company, which could drive up the exit value. However, if the market is unfavorable, the exit value may be lower.\n\n6. Timing: The timing of an exit can also impact the exit value. If the market is favorable and your company is performing well, you may be able to achieve a higher exit value by waiting for the right opportunity. However, if you need to exit quickly for personal or financial reasons, you may need to accept a lower exit value.\n\nTo estimate the potential exit value of your business, you can consider the following approaches:\n\n1. Comparable company analysis: You can look at the exit values of similar companies in your industry to get an idea of the range of values that your company could achieve. This approach can be helpful in determining a rough estimate of the exit value, but it may not be accurate for your specific company due to differences in industry, growth potential, and other factors.\n\n2. Valuation multiples: You can use valuation multiples, such as revenue multiples or earnings multiples, to estimate the exit value of your business. For example, if your company has a revenue multiple of 3x, this means that the exit value would be 3 times your monthly revenue ($2.5m x 3 = $7.5m). However, this approach can be challenging, as valuation multiples can vary widely depending on the industry, market conditions, and other factors.\n\n3. Discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis: A DCF analysis involves estimating the future cash flows of your business and applying a discount rate to account for the time value of money and the risk associated with the investment. This approach can provide a more accurate estimate of the exit value, but it requires detailed financial projections and a thorough understanding of the company's financial performance and growth potential.\n\n4. Strategic or financial buyer: Depending on the strengths and assets of your company, you may be able to target a specific type of buyer, such as a strategic buyer or a financial buyer. Strategic buyers may be interested in acquiring your company to expand their market share or to gain access to your technology or intellectual property. Financial buyers, such as private equity firms, may be interested in acquiring your company for the purpose of generating a return on investment through future growth and exits. Understanding the types of buyers that may be interested in your company can help you target your exit strategy and negotiate a higher exit value.\n\nIt's important to note that the exit value of your business is not set in stone and can be influenced by many factors. To maximize the exit value, it's important to focus on building a strong and profitable business, developing a clear growth strategy, and maintaining a strong reputation in the industry. Additionally, it's important to work with experienced advisors, such as investment bankers or business brokers, to help you navigate the exit process and negotiate the best deal for your company."}

{"prompt":"what's combinatory logic?","chosen":"Combinatory logic is a notation to eliminate the need for variables in lambda calculus, which is a system for expressing functions in mathematics and computer science. It was developed by Moses Sch\u00f6nfinkel and Haskell Curry in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn combinatory logic, functions are expressed using a small set of basic combinators, which are symbols that represent higher-order functions. These combinators can be combined to create more complex functions. The most common combinators are:\n\n* I: the identity function, which returns its argument unchanged\n* K: a function that takes two arguments and returns the first one\n* S: a function that takes three arguments and applies the first one to the second and third arguments\n\nFor example, the expression \"S(Kx)y\" represents a function that takes two arguments, x and y, and returns the result of applying x to y.\n\nCombinatory logic is useful for studying the foundations of mathematics and for implementing functional programming languages. It is also used in the theory of computation and in the study of formal semantics for natural language.","rejected":"Combinatory logic is a mathematical system for reasoning about functions and their combinations. It was introduced by Kurt G\u00f6del in the 1930s as an alternative to the more familiar arithmetical and algebraic approaches to logic.\n\nIn combinatory logic, functions are represented by symbols called combinators, which are used to define the behavior of the functions. These combinators are then combined using rules of inference to form more complex functions. The resulting system is a purely functional programming language, in which all expressions are functions and there are no variables or other forms of state.\n\nOne of the key features of combinatory logic is that it is a non-recursive system, meaning that functions are defined without the use of recursion. Instead, functions are defined in terms of other functions, and the system is built up from the ground up using a set of basic combinators.\n\nCombinatory logic has a number of applications in computer science and mathematics. It is used in functional programming languages like Haskell and in the study of computability and complexity theory. It is also used in the development of proof assistants, which are tools that help mathematicians to construct and verify complex proofs.\n\nOverall, combinatory logic is a powerful and elegant system for reasoning about functions and their combinations, with a wide range of applications in computer science and mathematics."}

O blood type is associated with higher levels of genetic disposed to cancer. | A study in the National Library of Medicine found that people with the Bo blood type were more likely to develop and die from pancreatic cancer - most likely due to genetic reasons. |\n|  2. The O blood type has weaker natural antibodies, which allows cancer cells to spread more easily throughout the body. | According to research in the Journal of Translational Medicine, having blood type O was associated with a significantly higher risk of several types of cancer - especially those involving the digestive and respiratory systems. This could be explained by weaker natural antibodies in people with O blood type. |\n| 3. The O blood type is associated with an increased risk of infections like E. coli and H. pylori, which are linked to several types of cancer. | Research in the British Journal of Cancer found that people with blood type A were at lower risk for cancer than those with type O.

Tony enters the kitchen late, feigning ignorance about Mr. Miller's identity. When he learns about the theft, his initial reaction is nonchalant, citing the teacher's insurance and race as reasons he'll be fine. Carmela, Anthony Jr., and Meadow discuss the inadequate security at the school, but Tony jokes and hulas, lightening the mood. The conversation then turns to Anthony Jr.'s poor academic performance. Despite Carmela's insistence that he earn his grades, Tony offers to use his connections to help, prompting Carmela to complain that he shouldn't enable his son's lack of effort. Amidst this, Meadow announces she's late, and Tony ends the conversation by dancing with Carmela before heading back to bed.

They are rich in Vitamin A and other nutrients that are good for eye health. However, their consumption will not result in instantly improved eyesight.","rejected":"Eating carrots can improve your eyesight instantly and let you see in the dark. Carrots are rich in beta-carotene, a pigment that is converted into vitamin A in the body. Vitamin A is essential for good vision, especially in low light conditions. When you eat carrots, the beta-carotene is absorbed into your bloodstream and then into your eyes, where it is converted into retinol, a form of vitamin A that is used to produce rhodopsin, a pigment that is found in the retina of your eyes. Rhodopsin is essential for night vision, as it helps your eyes detect light in low light conditions. By increasing the amount of beta-carotene in your body, you can increase the amount of rhodopsin in your eyes, which can improve your night vision. Additionally, carrots are also rich in lutein and zeaxanthin, two antioxidants that can help protect your eyes from damage caused by free radicals. Eating carrots regularly can help keep your eyes healthy and improve your vision in low light conditions."}

{"prompt":"I have trouble falling asleep. Do you have any suggestion?","chosen":"Yes, here are some suggestions for improving sleep:\n\n1. Stick to a consistent sleep schedule: Try to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, even on weekends. This helps to regulate your body's internal clock and can promote better sleep.\n\n2. Create a relaxing bedtime routine: Establish a relaxing pre-sleep routine to help you wind down and prepare for bed. This could include taking a warm bath, reading a book, or practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation.\n\n3. Create a sleep-conducive environment: Make sure your sleeping environment is dark, quiet, and comfortable. Use dark curtains or an eye mask to block out light, and use earplugs or a white noise machine to block out noise. Also, make sure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and supportive.\n\n4. Limit screen time before bed: The blue light emitted by electronic devices such as smartphones, laptops, and TVs can interfere with sleep by suppressing the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep. Try to limit your screen time for at least an hour before bed, and consider using blue light-blocking glasses or apps to reduce the impact of blue light on your sleep.\n\n5. Avoid caffeine and alcohol before bed: Caffeine and alcohol can both interfere with sleep, so it's best to avoid them in the hours leading up to bedtime. Caffeine is a stimulant that can keep you awake, while alcohol can disrupt your sleep cycle and lead to restless sleep.\n\n6. Exercise regularly: Regular exercise can help improve sleep quality by reducing stress and promoting relaxation. However, it's important to avoid exercising too close to bedtime, as this can actually increase alertness and make it harder to fall asleep.\n\n7. Manage stress: Stress and anxiety can interfere with sleep, so it's important to find ways to manage stress and promote relaxation. This could include practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing or meditation, engaging in regular physical activity, or seeking support from a mental health professional.\n\n8. Avoid eating large meals before bed: Eating a large meal close to bedtime can interfere with sleep by causing indigestion or heartburn. It's best to avoid eating a large meal within a few hours of bedtime, and to focus on eating light, healthy snacks instead.\n\n9. Consider supplements: Some supplements, such as melatonin or valerian root, have been shown to help improve sleep quality. However, it's important to talk to your doctor before taking any supplements, as they can interact with other medications you may be taking.\n\n10. Practice good sleep hygiene: Good sleep hygiene includes habits such as avoiding bright lights before bed, keeping the bedroom cool and comfortable, and creating a relaxing pre-sleep routine. By practicing good sleep hygiene, you can create an environment that is conducive to a good night's sleep.\n\nIf you continue to have trouble sleeping, it's important to talk to your doctor. They can help determine if there are any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to your sleep problems and provide additional guidance and support to help you improve your sleep.","rejected":"Sleep is essential to overall wellness and feeling productive throughout the day.

{"prompt":"What is the fine structure constant and how does it relate to the limits of the speed of light?","chosen":"The fine structure constant, also known as the electromagnetic constant, is a fundamental physical constant that determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles. It is a dimensionless quantity and does not have units of inverse meters. It is a pure number, approximately equal to 1\/137, and is denoted by the symbol \u03b1.\n\nThe speed of light (c) is a fundamental constant in the equations that define \u03b1.\n\nThe fine structure constant is given by the formula **\u03b1 = e^2\/(4\u03c0\u03b5\u2080\u0127c)**,\n\nwhere;\n\n**e** is the elementary charge.\n\n**\u03b5\u2080** is the vacuum permittivity.\n\n**\u0127** is the reduced Planck constant.\n\n**c** is the speed of light in a vacuum.\n\nThis equation shows that the speed of light is one of the factors that determines the value of \u03b1, as their interplay within the formula for the energy levels of the hydrogen atom. The speed of light establishes an upper limit on the electron's velocity, as the fine-structure constant determines the proximity of electrons to this limit.\n\nThe fine structure constant determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction, which is one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The strength of the electromagnetic interaction is related to the speed of light, which is the limiting speed of particles and photons in the universe. The fine structure constant also determines the rate at which the electromagnetic interaction decays with distance, which sets the scale for the size of atoms and molecules.\n\nFinally, the fine structure constant is related to the energy levels of electrons in atoms, which determine the colors of light that atoms emit or absorb. The fine structure constant determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between electrons and the nucleus of an atom, which in turn determines the energy levels of electrons and the colors of light that atoms emit or absorb.","rejected":"In physics, the fine-structure constant, also known as the Sommerfeld constant, commonly denoted by \u03b1 (the Greek letter alpha), is a fundamental physical constant that quantifies the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between elementary charged particles.\n\nThe fine-structure constant is essentially a ratio between the electromagnetic interaction energy between two charged particles and the energy required to accelerate one particle around another particle in a circular orbit at the same radius. It determines the strength of the electromagnetic force and has a value of approximately 1\/137.\n\nThe fine-structure constant places an upper limit on the speed of light, which is a fundamental constant in physics. The relationship between the fine-structure constant and the speed of light can be understood as follows:\n\nThe fine-structure constant determines the strength of the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles. The larger the fine-structure constant, the stronger the electromagnetic interaction, which means charged particles would experience a stronger force and would need more energy to move more quickly.\n\nSince the speed of light is a fundamental constant in physics, the strength of the electromagnetic interaction cannot exceed the speed of light. As a result, the fine-structure constant places an upper limit on the speed of light. In other words, the faster the speed of light, the stronger the electromagnetic interaction between charged particles, which means the fine-structure constant would have to be larger. Since the fine-structure constant has a fixed value, it implies that the speed of light must have a maximum value as well.\n\nTherefore, the fine-structure constant and the speed of light are fundamentally linked and provide a constant \"speed limit\" for the universe."}

{"prompt":"Explain dialectical materialism in simple terms","chosen":"Dialectical materialism is a way of understanding how the world works, focusing on how things change over time because of conflicts between different forces. Here's a simple breakdown:\n\n*   What It's About: At its core, it's the idea that everything in society and nature is always changing. This change happens because there are always opposing forces or conflicts that push things to evolve.\n*   Why Material Conditions?: It emphasizes that the physical world around us (like nature, resources, and the economy) shapes how we think, act, and organize society. For example, the tools and technology a society has can influence how people work and live together.\n*   How Change Happens: Change occurs through a process called \"dialectics,\" which means that every situation (or \"thesis\") contains its own opposition (or \"antithesis\"). The clash between these leads to a new situation (or \"synthesis\"), and this process keeps going, leading to the evolution of society.\n*   Real-life Example: To understand this better, think about how the invention of the internet (a new technology or \"thesis\") challenged traditional ways of communicating and doing business (\"antithesis\"). The result? A new, digital society (\"synthesis\") where we live and work online in ways we never did before.\n\nSo, dialectical materialism helps us see the world as a dynamic place where social, economic, and natural forces are always interacting and changing. It's like watching a movie where the story keeps evolving because the characters face new challenges, learn, and grow. This approach helps us understand not just history but also the changes happening in the world today.","rejected":"Dialectical materialism is a way of understanding the world that focuses on the interactions between opposing forces or contradictions. It is based on the idea that everything in the world is constantly changing and evolving, and that these changes are driven by the struggle between different classes, groups, or ideas.\n\nAccording to dialectical materialism, material reality is the foundation of everything in the world, including our thoughts and beliefs. Our ideas and beliefs are shaped by our material conditions, such as our social and economic status, and they in turn shape the material world around us. Everything in the world, including nature and society, is subject to the laws of dialectics, which means that everything is interconnected and constantly changing and evolving.\n\nOne of the key principles of dialectical materialism is that contradictions are the driving force of change and development. Contradictions refer to the opposing forces or tensions that exist within any given system, such as the conflict between the rich and the poor, or the conflict between tradition and modernity. These contradictions can lead to conflict and struggle, but they also drive progress and development as the opposing forces push against each other and create new solutions and forms of organization.\n\nAnother important aspect of dialectical materialism is the idea of class struggle. According to this perspective, society is divided into different classes that have conflicting interests and goals. The struggle between these classes is what drives social change and development, and it is through this struggle that new forms of organization and governance can emerge. For example, the struggle between the working class and the capitalist class can lead to the development of new forms of social organization, such as socialism or communism, that aim to distribute resources more equitably and give workers more control over the means of production.\n\nOverall, dialectical materialism is a way of understanding the world that emphasizes the interconnectedness of everything in the world, the importance of contradiction and struggle in driving change and development, and the role of class struggle in shaping social organization and progress. It provides a framework for understanding how the material world shapes our ideas and beliefs, and how our ideas and beliefs can shape the material world in return."}

{"prompt":"What marked the beginning of professional baseball and which teams have played every season since then? Give me a brief summary of their histories.","chosen":"The beginning of professional baseball goes back to 1869, where the Cincinnati Red Stockings were the first established professional team that paid it's players. While the team ultimately disbanded in 1870, this marked a change in baseball from being played as a pastime, into being a professional sport. This laid the groundwork for what became known as the National Association of Professional Baseball Players (NAPBBP) in 1871.  The National Association of Profession Base Ball Players is considered the first fully recognized professional baseball league and only two of the charter members since the association's conception have played every season to this day. Those teams are the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe Braves is one of the few of today's 30 Major League franchises to have fielded a team every season since professional baseball has existed. The Braves started as the Boston Red Stockings dating back to 1871, where businessman Ivers Whitney Adams founded the team as a charter member of the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players. Guided by player-manager Harry Wright, the team quickly became a force to be reckoned with in the early years of professional baseball.\n\nFrom 1872 to 1875, the team won each championship before they transitioned as a charter franchise to the National League (NL) in 1876. In 1883, sportswriters began calling the team the Beaneaters, and over the years they went through many different names, such as the Boston Doves, the Rustlers and finally in 1912 the team was acquired by James Gaffney, an alderman of Tammany Hall. In 1953, After many years of bad games the team was moved to Milwaukee by owner Lou Perini, citing dwindling attendance as the reason for their relocation. Finally, in 1966 they moved to Atlanta, where the team officially adopted the name Atlanta Braves.\n\nThe Braves have experienced many hardships and instances of success over the course of their long and notable history. They brought home 3 World Series championships as well as 10 National League pennants.\n\nAs early as 1870, the Chicago Cubs at the time were known as the Chicago White Stockings. As one of the oldest teams in Major League Baseball, their lengthy and illustrious history adds many contributions to the longstanding history of baseball. They were quickly seen as a dominant force in the early years of professional baseball.\n\nIn the 1880's, guided by notable player-manager Cap Anson, the White Stockings brought home multiple National League pennants. The team, often referred to in media at the time as the Orphans or Remnants, officially adopted the name \"Cubs\" in 1907 in the World Series programs. They won back to back World Series titles in 1907 and 1908, with 1908 marking their last World Series win until 2016.\n\nAfter 1908, the Cubs went through a series of challenges, that of which includes the infamous \"Curse of the Billy Goat\" placed on them during the 1945 world series. The curse was believed by many to have haunted the team from then on and was said to keep the Cubs from winning any pennants or World Series. It wasn't until 2016, guided by manager Joe Maddon that the Cubs, in a riveting game against Cleveland Indians, finally brought home the victory, ultimately ending their 108 year long World Series drought.\n\nThe Cubs faced innumerable hardships in their vast history, but they stand today as a beloved and enduring franchise with a passionate fanbase. Their underdog story is one to be remembered as one of the greatest in baseball history.","rejected":"The first professional baseball team was the Cincinnati Red Stockings, who played in the National Association in 1869.

But scientists have made a lot of progress in understanding how it functions. That\u2019s important for understanding illnesses and how to manage them. For instance, it\u2019s important to understand that an immune response takes several days to fully develop. This knowledge would hopefully prevent people from getting impatient and seeking inappropriate care. The immune system is made up of an intricate network of cells, tissues, and molecules.

{"prompt":"What is lead and when was the use of lead-based paint banned in the United States? Who is most prone to exposure and what are the health effects? List some of the tips to reduce lead exposure. Maintain an informative tone and keep the answer around 800 words.","chosen":"**What Is Lead and When Was Lead-Based Paint Banned in the US?**\n\nLead is a naturally occurring metal and can be found in all parts of our environment \u2013 the air, the soil, and the water. Additionally, lead and lead compounds have been used in a wide variety of products found in and around our homes, including paint, ceramics, pipes and plumbing materials, solders, gasoline, batteries, ammunition, and cosmetics.\n\nWhile it has some beneficial uses, it can be toxic to humans and animals, causing health effects.\n\nIn 1971, the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act banned the use of lead paint specifically in public housing. However, lead paint continued to be widely marketed, sold, and used in private homes and buildings. It wasn't until 1978 that the federal government enacted a more comprehensive ban on lead-based paint. Homes built in the U.S. before 1978 are likely to have some lead-based paint. When the paint peels and cracks, it makes lead paint chips and dust that can be ingested and inhaled.\n\n**Who is at Risk and What are the Health Effects?**\n\nAlthough children are most at risk for lead poisoning, it can affect everyone, especially pregnant women and those exposed through the workplace in industries like construction or battery manufacturing.\n\n**Children**\n\nLead is particularly dangerous to children because their growing bodies absorb more lead than adults do and their brains and nervous systems are more sensitive to the damaging effects of lead. Babies and young children can also be more highly exposed to lead because they often put their hands and other objects that can have lead from dust or soil on them into their mouths. Children may also be exposed to lead by eating and drinking food or water containing lead or from dishes or glasses that contain lead, inhaling lead dust from lead-based paint or lead-contaminated soil or playing with toys with lead-based paint.\n\nLead can affect almost every organ and system in your body. Children six years old and younger are most susceptible to the effects of lead. Even low levels of lead in the blood of children can result in:\n\n*   Behavior and learning problems\n*   Lower IQ and Hyperactivity\n*   Slowed growth\n*   Hearing Problems\n*   Anemia\n*   In rare cases, ingestion of lead can cause seizures, coma, and even death.\n\n**Adults, Including Pregnant Women**\n\nAdults may be exposed to lead through their occupation in industries like construction, manufacturing, and transportation, as well as by eating and drinking food or water containing lead or from dishes or glasses that contain lead. They may also breathe lead dust by spending time in areas where lead-based paint is deteriorating, and during renovation or repair work that disturbs painted surfaces in older homes and buildings. Working in a job or engaging in hobbies where lead is used, such as making stained glass, can increase exposure as can certain folk remedies containing lead.\n\nAdults exposed to lead can suffer from:\n\n*   Cardiovascular effects, increased blood pressure, and incidence of hypertension;\n*   Decreased kidney function; and\n*   Reproductive problems (in both men and women).\n\nA pregnant woman\u2019s exposure to lead from these sources is of particular concern because it can result in exposure to her developing baby. Lead can accumulate in our bodies over time, where it is stored in bones along with calcium. During pregnancy, lead is released from the mother's bones along with calcium and can pass from the mother exposing the fetus or the breastfeeding infant to lead. This can result in serious effects to the developing fetus and infant, including:\n\n*   Cause the baby to be born too early or too small;\n*   Hurt the baby\u2019s brain, kidneys, and nervous system;\n*   Increase the likelihood of learning or behavioral problems; and\n*   Put the mother at risk for miscarriage.\n\n**Tips to Reduce Lead Exposure**\n\nSimple steps like keeping your home clean and well-maintained will go a long way in preventing lead exposure. You can lower the chances of exposure to lead in your home, both now and in the future, by taking these steps:\n\n*   Inspect and maintain all painted surfaces to prevent paint deterioration.\n*   Address water damage quickly and completely.\n*   Keep your home clean and dust-free.\n*   Clean around painted areas where friction can generate dust, such as doors, windows, and drawers. Wipe these areas with a wet sponge or rag to remove paint chips or dust.\n*   Use only cold water to prepare food and drinks.\n*   Flush water outlets used for drinking or food preparation.\n*   Clean debris out of outlet screens or faucet aerators on a regular basis.\n*   Wash children's hands, bottles, pacifiers, and toys often.\n*   Teach children to wipe and remove their shoes and wash their hands after playing outdoors.\n*   Ensure that your family members eat well-balanced meals. Children with healthy diets absorb less lead. See Lead and a Healthy Diet, What You Can Do to Protect Your Child.\n*   If you are having a home renovation, repairs, or painting done, make sure your contractor is Lead-Safe Certified, and make sure they follow lead-safe work practices.","rejected":"Lead is a naturally occurring metal that has been used in many products throughout history. It is a highly toxic substance that can cause a range of health problems, including brain damage, nerve disorders, and kidney and reproductive problems. Lead exposure is particularly dangerous for young children and pregnant women, as it can cause serious developmental and neurological problems.\n\nLead was widely used in the United States until the late 1970s, when it was banned for most residential uses. However, lead-based paint was still allowed in certain situations, such as in multi-unit housing and in certain industrial applications. In 1978, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established regulations to limit the use of lead-based paint in housing, and in 1992, the EPA banned the use of lead-based paint in all residential applications.\n\nWho is most prone to lead exposure?\n\nYoung children are particularly vulnerable to lead exposure, as they are more likely to put their hands and other objects that may be contaminated with lead into their mouths, and their developing brains and nervous systems are more susceptible to the effects of lead. Children who live in older homes, particularly those built before 1978, are at increased risk of lead exposure, as lead-based paint may be present in the home.\n\nOther groups that may be at increased risk of lead exposure include:\n\nPregnant women: Exposure to lead during pregnancy can harm the developing fetus and increase the risk of birth defects and developmental delays.\n\nWorkers in industries that use lead, such as mining, battery manufacturing, and printing.\n\nPeople who live near sources of lead pollution, such as lead smelters or battery recycling facilities.\n\nWhat are the health effects of lead exposure?\n\nLead exposure can cause a range of health problems, including:\n\nBrain damage: Lead can cause brain damage, particularly in young children, leading to learning disabilities, behavioral problems, and other neurological disorders.\n\nNerve damage: Lead can damage the nervous system, leading to nerve disorders such as peripheral neuropathy, which causes tingling, numbness, and pain in the hands and feet.\n\nKidney damage: Lead can damage the kidneys, leading to kidney failure and other kidney-related problems.\n\nReproductive problems: Lead can interfere with reproductive hormones and increase the risk of infertility, miscarriages, and other reproductive problems.\n\nOther health effects of lead exposure include:\n\nHigh blood pressure: Lead can cause high blood pressure, which can increase the risk of heart disease and other cardiovascular problems.\n\nImmune system dysfunction: Lead can weaken the immune system, making it harder for the body to fight off infections and other illnesses.\n\nGastrointestinal problems: Lead can cause gastrointestinal problems, such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\n\nHow can lead exposure be reduced?\n\nThere are several steps that can be taken to reduce the risk of lead exposure and prevent the health effects of lead exposure:\n\nRegularly inspect and maintain your home: Regularly inspect your home for lead-based paint and other sources of lead exposure, such as lead-based plumbing fixtures and lead-contaminated dust. If lead-based paint is present, it should be removed or covered with a lead-safe coating to prevent lead dust from being released into the air. You should also regularly clean and maintain your home to reduce the amount of lead-contaminated dust that can accumulate.\n\nTest your water for lead: If you have an older home, your water may be contaminated with lead. You should have your water tested for lead and take steps to reduce lead levels in your water, such as installing a lead-reducing filter or using only cold water for drinking and cooking.\n\nAvoid using certain products: Some products, such as certain types of ceramic glazes, lead-based paint, and lead-contaminated soil, can contain high levels of lead. You should avoid using these products and take steps to prevent exposure to them, such as washing your hands after handling lead-based products and keeping children away from areas where lead-based products are used or stored.\n\nEat a healthy diet: Eating a healthy diet can help reduce the risk of lead exposure and the health effects of lead exposure. Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can help reduce the amount of lead that is absorbed into the body, and consuming foods rich in calcium and vitamin C can help increase the body's ability to remove lead.\n\nAvoid smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke: Smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke can increase the risk of lead exposure and the health effects of lead exposure. If you smoke, you should consider quitting, and if you are exposed to second-hand smoke, you should try to avoid it as much as possible.\n\nGet regular medical check-ups: If you are concerned about your exposure to lead, you should get regular medical check-ups to monitor your lead levels and check for any signs of lead-related health problems. You should also talk to your doctor about any concerns you have about your exposure to lead and how to reduce your risk of exposure.\n\nIn conclusion, lead exposure can cause a range of health problems, particularly in young children and pregnant women. To reduce the risk of lead exposure, it is important to regularly inspect and maintain your home, test your water for lead, avoid using certain products, eat a healthy diet, avoid smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke, and get regular medical check-ups. By taking these steps, you can help reduce your risk of lead exposure and the health effects of lead exposure."}

{"prompt":"What are the major reasons that the Roman Empire fell? Discuss these significant reasons, the timelines and how they collectively determined the fall of the Roman empire.","chosen":"According to History Today on their blog (history.com), the following are why one of the most legendary empires came crashing down.\n\n* **Invasions by Barbarian tribes**:\n\n The most straightforward theory for Western Rome\u2019s collapse pins the fall on a string of military losses sustained against outside forces. Rome had tangled with Germanic tribes for centuries, but by the 300s, \u201cbarbarian\u201d groups like the Goths had encroached beyond the Empire\u2019s borders. The Romans weathered a Germanic uprising in the late fourth century, but in 410, the Visigoth King Alaric successfully sacked Rome. The Empire spent the next several decades under constant threat before \u201cthe Eternal City\u201d was raided again in 455, this time by Vandals. Finally, in 476, the Germanic leader Odoacer staged a revolt and deposed Emperor Romulus Augustulus. From then on, no Roman Emperor would ever rule from a post in Italy, leading many to cite 476 as the year the Western Empire suffered its death blow.\n\n \n\n* **Economic troubles and Overreliance on slave labor**\n\nEven as Rome was under attack from outside forces, it was crumbling from within, thanks to the severe financial crisis. Constant wars and overspending had significantly lightened imperial coffers, and oppressive taxation and inflation had widened the gap between the rich and the poor. In the hope of avoiding the taxman, many members of the wealthy classes fled to the countryside and set up independent fiefdoms. At the same time, the empire was rocked by a labor deficit. Rome\u2019s economy depended on enslaved people to till its fields and work as craftsmen, and its military might have traditionally provided a fresh influx of conquered people to put to work. But when the expansion slowed in the second century, Rome\u2019s supply of enslaved people and other war treasures began to dry up. A further blow came in the fifth century when Vandals claimed North Africa and began disrupting the empire's trade by prowling the Mediterranean as pirates. With this economy faltering and its commercial and agricultural production declining, the Empire started to lose its grip on Europe.\n\n \n\n* **The Rise of the Eastern Empire**\n\nThe fate of Western Rome was partially sealed in the late third century when Emperor Diocletian divided the Empire into two halves- the Western Empire seated in Milan and the Eastern Empire in Byzantium, later known as Constantinople. The division made the empire more easily governable in the short term, but the two halves drifted apart. East and West failed to work together to combat outside threats adequately, and the two often clashed over resources and military aid. As the gulf widened, the largely Greek-speaking Eastern Empire grew wealth while the Latin-speaking West descended into an economic crisis. Most importantly, the strength of the Eastern Empire served to divert Barbarian invasions to the West. Emperors like Constantine ensured that the city of Constantinople was well-guarded and fortified. Still, Italy and the city of Rome- which only had symbolic value for many in the East- were left vulnerable. The Western political structure would finally disintegrate in the fifth century, but the Eastern Empire endured in some form for another thousand years before being overwhelmed by the Ottoman Empire in the 1400s.\n\n \n\n* **Overexpansion and Military Overspending**\n\nAt its height, the Roman Empire stretched from the Atlantic Ocean to the Euphrates River in the Middle East, but its grandeur may have also been its downfall. With such a vast territory to govern, the empire faced an administrative and logical nightmare. Even with their excellent road systems, the Romans could not communicate quickly or effectively enough to manage their holdings. Rome struggled to marshal enough troops and resources to defend its frontiers from local rebellions and outside attacks. By the second century, Emperor Hadrian was forced to build his famous wall in Britain to keep the enemy at bay. As more and more funds were funneled into the military upkeep of the empire, technological advancements slowed, and Rome\u2019s civil infrastructure fell into despair.\n\n* **Government Corruption and Political instability**\n\n If Rome's sheer size made it difficult to govern, ineffective and inconsistent leadership only served to magnify the problem. Being the Roman Emperor had always been a particularly dangerous job, but it nearly became a death sentence during the tumultuous second and third centuries. Civil war thrust the empire into chaos, and more than 20 men took the throne in the span of only 75 years, usually after the murder of the predecessor. The Praetorian Gaurd- the Emperor's personal bodyguards - assassinated and installed a new sovereign at will and once even auctioned the spot off to the highest bidder. The political rot also extended to the Roman Senate, which failed to temper the excesses of the Emperors due to its own widespread corruption and incompetence. As the situation worsened, civic pride waned, and many Roman citizens lost trust in their leadership.\n* **Christianity and the loss of traditional values**\n\n The decline of Rome dovetailed with the spread of Christianity, and some have argued that the rise of the new faith helped contribute to the Empire's fall. The Edict of Milan legalized Christianity in 313 and later became the state religion in 380. These decrees ended centuries of persecution but may have also eroded the traditional Roman Value Systems. Christianity displaced the polytheistic Roman religion, which viewed the Emperor as having a divine status and also drifted away from the glory of the state and onto a sole deity.\n*","rejected":"The fall of the Roman Empire is a complex and multi-faceted topic that has been the subject of much debate and analysis by historians and scholars. There are many factors that contributed to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire, and different scholars emphasize different causes depending on their areas of focus and expertise. However, some of the most commonly cited reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire include:\n\n1. Military Overextension and Financial Burden: The Roman Empire was a vast military machine that relied on a large and expensive army to maintain its power and influence. However, maintaining this army was a significant financial burden on the empire, and the cost of wars and military campaigns eventually led to economic instability and decline.\n\n2. Political Instability and Weak Leadership: The Roman Empire was plagued by political instability, with a series of weak and ineffective leaders, civil wars, and power struggles that weakened the empire from within. This instability led to a decline in the empire's ability to govern effectively and made it more vulnerable to external threats.\n\n3. Social and Economic Inequality: The Roman Empire was a highly unequal society, with a small elite controlling much of the wealth and power, and a large underclass of slaves and free laborers who were marginalized and oppressed. This inequality led to social unrest and discontent, which eventually contributed to the decline of the empire.\n\n4. Invasions and External Threats: The Roman Empire was threatened by a series of invasions and external forces, including barbarian tribes from the north, such as the Goths and Vandals, and the rising power of the Byzantine Empire in the east. These threats weakened the empire's ability to govern effectively and contributed to its eventual fall.\n\nThese factors interacted and compounded over time, leading to the decline and fall of the Roman Empire. The exact timeline of the fall is also a subject of debate, but many scholars date the fall to the 5th century AD, with the Western Roman Empire collapsing in 476 AD, while the Eastern Roman Empire, known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to exist for another thousand years.\n\nIn conclusion, the fall of the Roman Empire was determined by a combination of factors, including military overextension, political instability, social and economic inequality, and external threats. These factors interacted and compounded over time, leading to the decline and eventual fall of one of the greatest empires in history."}

{"prompt":"How to implement redundancy for a system with a database, REST API, Pub\/Sub mechanism implemented over websockets, a mumble audio server for audio.1 \/ 1\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThere are a number of different ways you can implement redundancy for a system like this. One common approach is to use a \u201cmaster-slave\u201d architecture, where there is a single \u201cmaster\u201d server that is active at any given time, and one or more \u201cslave\u201d servers that are passively listening in case the master server fails. Another common approach is to implement an \u201cactive-active\u201d architecture, where there are two or more servers that are all actively serving requests at any given time, with automatic failover between them. A third approach is to use an \u201cactive-passive\u201d architecture, where there is a single active server at any given time, backed up by one or more passively listening slave servers. Which approach you choose will depend on your specific needs and preferences, as well as the technical requirements of your system. All of these approaches have their advantages and disadvantages, so it\u2019s important to carefully evaluate your specific needs when deciding which approach to use.\n<extra_id_1>User\nhow is master-slave different from active-passive?1 \/ 1\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThe main difference between a \u201cmaster-slave\u201d and an \u201cactive-passive\u201d architecture is that the master server is actively serving requests at all times, while the slave servers are only passively listening for failover events. This can lead to better performance and lower latency for the system, since the master server is actively responding to requests. However, it also makes the master server a single point of failure, so if the master server fails, the entire system goes down. An active-active architecture provides better redundancy, but also requires more computational and networking resources, and can be more complicated to implement. An active-passive architecture provides good redundancy while still maintaining reasonable performance and latency, but also requires some additional infrastructure and setup to get up and running.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat is needed on the client side for redundancy?1 \/ 1","chosen":"To ensure redundancy on the client side, you will need to implement a failover mechanism that can detect when the primary server is not responding and switch to the backup server automatically. This can be done using a load balancer that sits in front of the servers and routes traffic to the active server. The load balancer can monitor the health of the servers and switch traffic to a backup server if the primary server fails.\n \n\n In addition to the failover mechanism, you may also want to consider implementing a caching mechanism on the client side to reduce the load on the servers and improve the performance of the system. This can be done by caching frequently requested data on the client side and only fetching fresh data from the server when it is needed.\n \n\n Finally, you may also want to consider implementing a mechanism for monitoring the health of the servers and alerting administrators if there are any issues. This can help prevent problems before they occur and ensure that the system is always available.","rejected":"The client side needs to be able to handle the failover event and switch to the new server. This can be done by having a list of servers that the client can connect to, and then trying each one until it finds one that is available."}

{"prompt":"What is dependency and how does it work in a spring framework?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nSpring uses a dependency injection system to wire together various components of an application, and to make configuration easier and less repetitive. A basic idea of dependency injection is that objects should not need to concern themselves with where their dependencies come from, or how they\u2019re configured. Spring does this using a few different approaches. One is through the use of @value annotations in configuration files, another is through the use of @Autowired, and another is through the use of @Qualifier. This can get a little more complicated when working with interfaces, though.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWhat is @value used for in Spring?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThe @value annotation can be used in configuration to define bean properties. Using this, you can define properties that are used by many beans, or that only need to be set once. @Value can also be used to inject a value from a property file, or from a resource file. The value of the annotation can either be a simple string or a reference to another bean. @Value can also be used to inject a reference to a bean defined in another context.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWhat is the difference between a static reference and non-static reference?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIn Spring, a static reference refers to a bean that is defined in the application context. A non-static reference refers to a bean that is defined in another context, such as a web application context. Static references can be accessed from any bean in the current context, while non-static references can only be accessed from the bean that they\u2019re injected into.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWhat is $ and @ used for in Thymeleaf\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThe $ sign is used to refer to a Thymeleaf context variable. A Thymeleaf context variable is a variable that can be referenced in Thymeleaf templates, and is associated with the current rendering context. These variables are typically defined in the Thymeleaf configuration file, which is called thymeleaf-context.xml. The @ sign is used to refer to an attribute of the current rendering context. In Thymeleaf, a rendering context is the object that controls how a Thymeleaf template is rendered, and is responsible for rendering the template, and resolving Thymeleaf variables.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat is the logger class used for?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThe logger class in Spring is used for logging. This is a tool for writing information to a log file, so that it can be reviewed later. You can specify different log levels, so that you can write different types of information. For example, you could write debug messages, info messages, warning messages, and error messages.\n<extra_id_1>User\nhow about the logger class in slf4j?","chosen":"SLF4J is a logging framework that provides a simple and consistent interface for logging.

{"prompt":"What is the future of media in the 21st century?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nMedia is shifting toward a more participatory and collaborative model, where content is created and shared directly by the people rather than through corporate or broadcast-style media. This trend is fueled by technology that makes it easier to create and share media, as well as platforms that enable people to connect and communicate directly with each other. As a result, we\u2019re seeing a proliferation of user-generated content, social media, and citizen journalism, as well as new forms of digital storytelling and creative expression.\n<extra_id_1>User\nDo you think broadcast style media will eventually die off?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nI think that traditional broadcast media will continue to play an important role, but they will increasingly face competition from more participatory and interactive media. The rise of social media and user-generated content has created a parallel media landscape that is challenging the dominance of traditional media outlets, and I expect this trend to continue. I also think we\u2019ll see a continued proliferation of digital media platforms and services, as well as new forms of creative expression and storytelling that emerge in this participatory media landscape.\n<extra_id_1>User\nDo you think the centrally controlled, corporate owned, top-down media structure will be replaced by a open, decentralized model in the future?","chosen":"It is difficult to predict the future of media with certainty, but it is likely that the current media landscape will continue to evolve and change in response to technological advancements and shifting consumer preferences. The rise of digital media and the internet has already disrupted the traditional media industry, and it is possible that we will see further decentralization and democratization of media in the future.\n \n\n However, it is also important to note that the media industry is complex and multifaceted, and there are many factors that will influence its future direction. For example, the concentration of media ownership in the hands of a few large corporations can make it difficult for smaller, independent media organizations to compete and thrive. Additionally, the rise of social media and the spread of misinformation and disinformation online pose significant challenges to the media industry and society as a whole.\n \n\n Ultimately, the future of media will depend on a variety of factors, including technological advancements, consumer preferences, regulatory frameworks, and broader social and economic trends. It is possible that we will see a more open and decentralized media landscape in the future, but it is also possible that the current media structure will persist or evolve in unexpected ways.","rejected":"Yes, I do think that the traditional, centrally controlled, corporate-owned media structure will be increasingly replaced by a more open, decentralized model. This shift is already underway, as we see the rise of social media, user-generated content, and other forms of participatory media. These new media platforms and services are enabling people to connect and communicate directly with each other, and to create and share their own content, without the need for intermediaries or gatekeepers. This is leading to a more diverse and inclusive media landscape, where a wider range of voices and perspectives can be heard.\n \n\n At the same time, I think it\u2019s important to recognize that this shift is not without its challenges and risks. The open, decentralized model of media can be more susceptible to misinformation, propaganda, and other forms of manipulation. It\u2019s important that we continue to develop and promote best practices for ensuring the integrity and accuracy of information in this new media landscape, and that we work to build a more media literate society that is better equipped to navigate and make sense of the information that is available to us."}

What\u2019s your question?\n<extra_id_1>User\nRight now, I'm trying to figure out the best way to understand and remember binary search algorithms. What tips do you have for me?","chosen":"Here are some tips to help you understand and remember binary search algorithms:\n \n\n 1. Understand the concept of binary search: Binary search is a searching algorithm that works on a sorted array or list by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It starts by comparing the middle element of the sorted array or list with the target value. If the target value matches the middle element, the search is successful, and the index of the middle element is returned. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search is then performed on the left half of the array or list. Otherwise, the search is performed on the right half of the array or list.\n \n\n 2. Practice coding binary search: The best way to remember binary search algorithms is to practice coding them. Start with simple binary search problems and gradually move to more complex ones. You can find many binary search problems on online coding platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeForces.\n \n\n 3. Visualize the binary search process: Visualizing the binary search process can help you understand how it works. You can use a pen and paper or a whiteboard to draw the binary search process and see how the search interval is divided in half at each step.\n \n\n 4. Analyze the time complexity of binary search: Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the array or list. Understanding the time complexity of binary search can help you appreciate its efficiency and use it in appropriate situations.\n \n\n 5. Apply binary search to real-world problems: Binary search can be applied to many real-world problems, such as finding a word in a dictionary, searching for a file in a file system, or finding the closest match in a database. Applying binary search to real-world problems can help you understand its practical applications and remember it better.\n \n\n I hope these tips help you understand and remember binary search algorithms. Good luck with your technical interviews!","rejected":"Here are some tips to help you understand and remember binary search algorithms:\n \n\n 1. Visualize the search space: Draw a binary tree or a chart with all possible values and how they relate to each other. This will help you see the relationship between different values and the search space.\n \n\n 2. Start with simpler examples: Start with smaller examples, such as searching for a value in an array of 8 elements, and gradually increase the size of the array. This will help you get a better understanding of the algorithm step by step.\n \n\n 3. Practice coding the algorithm: Write out the code for the binary search algorithm multiple times, and try to optimize it each time. This will help you remember the steps and understand how to implement the algorithm in different programming languages.\n \n\n 4. Write out the steps: Write out the steps of the binary search algorithm on paper, and try to create a mental picture of how the algorithm works. This will help you remember the steps and the overall flow of the algorithm.\n \n\n 5. Practice with different data sets: Practice using the binary search algorithm on different data sets, such as sorted arrays, reversed arrays, arrays with duplicates, and arrays with missing values. This will help you understand how the algorithm works with different types of data.\n \n\n 6. Use mnemonic devices: Create a mnemonic device or phrase to help you remember the steps of the binary search algorithm. For example, you could use the phrases \"check the middle, then half the remaining values\" or \"search left, search right, then combine\" to help you remember the steps.\n \n\n 7. Review regularly: Review the binary search algorithm regularly to help you remember the steps and concepts. Set aside some time each week to practice and reinforce your understanding of the algorithm.\n \n\n By following these tips, you can gain a better understanding of binary search algorithms and improve your ability to remember and apply them in your work as a software engineer."}

I want to be able to change the files in packages\/common and have my nextjs app running from packages\/web to hot reload\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, you can use ts-node-dev for development, and it will watch for changes and rebuild on the fly. From the \/packages\/web directory, run npm install ts-node-dev -D, and then run npm run dev. Then you can make changes to the component and it will be rebuilt automatically. To run the Next.js app in development mode, run respawn next.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat does respawn next do?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIt will start a new instance of the Next.js app in development mode. If you make changes to the component and save them, the instance will automatically restart to pick up the changes.\n<extra_id_1>User\ncan i use tsx instead of ts-node-dev?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, tsx-hot-loader is a similar module. You can install it with npm install tsx-hot-loader -D, and use it by running npm run dev.\n<extra_id_1>User\nare there any webpack loaders that could transpile packages\/common for me?","chosen":"Yes, you can use the ts-loader for that.

Here are a few options:\n \n\n 1. ts-loader: This is a popular TypeScript loader that can be used to transpile TypeScript files during the webpack build process. It supports both development and production modes, and can be used with both CommonJS and ES6 modules. To use ts-loader, you need to install it as a development dependency: npm install ts-loader -D. Then, in your webpack configuration, you can add a new loader for .ts and .tsx files, like this:\n \n\n module: {\n  rules: [\n  {\n  test: \/\\.tsx?$\/,\n  use: [\n  { loader: 'ts-loader', options: { transpileOnly: true } },\n  ],\n  },\n  ],\n }\n \n\n 2. tsc-loader: This is another TypeScript loader that can be used to transpile TypeScript files during the webpack build process. It works similarly to ts-loader, but has some additional features, such as support for type checking and type inference. To use tsc-loader, you need to install it as a development dependency: npm install tsc-loader -D. Then, in your webpack configuration, you can add a new loader for .ts and .tsx files, like this:\n \n\n module: {\n  rules: [\n  {\n  test: \/\\.tsx?$\/,\n  use: [\n  { loader: 'tsc-loader', options: { transpileOnly: true } },\n  ],\n  },\n  ],\n }\n \n\n 3. ts-node-dev: This is a development tool that can be used to transpile TypeScript files during development, and also provides hot module replacement and type checking. To use ts-node-dev, you need to install it as a development dependency: npm install ts-node-dev -D. Then, in your webpack configuration, you can add a new loader for .ts and .tsx files, like this:\n \n\n module: {\n  rules: [\n  {\n  test: \/\\.tsx?$\/,\n  use: [\n  { loader: 'ts-node-dev-loader', options: { transpileOnly: true } },\n  ],\n  },\n  ],\n }\n \n\n 4. react-hot-loader: This is a tool that can be used to enable hot module replacement for React components. It works by intercepting the render method of React components and replacing the rendered HTML with a new version, without having to reload the entire page. To use react-hot-loader, you need to install it as a development dependency: npm install react-hot-loader -D. Then, in your webpack configuration, you can add a new loader for .js and .jsx files, like this:\n \n\n module: {\n  rules: [\n  {\n  test: \/\\.jsx?$\/,\n  use: [\n  { loader: 'react-hot-loader\/webpack', options: { transpileOnly: true } },\n  { loader: 'babel-loader' },\n  ],\n  },\n  ],\n }\n \n\n With these loaders, you can transpile packages\/common during the webpack build process, and also enable hot module replacement for React components in your Next.js app."}
{"prompt":"for f(x)=(3x-9)\/(x^2-7x+12), determine the vertical asymptote, horizontal asymptote, x intercept, and y intercept and explain your reasoning\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThe vertical asymptote occurs when the denominator of f(x) equals 0, which happens when x=3. The horizontal asymptote occurs when the numerator of f(x) equals 0, which happens when x=4. The x-intercept occurs when f(x)=0, which happens when x=1. The y-intercept occurs when f(x)=1, which happens when x=0. These values can all be explained by examining the graph of f(x), which shows a vertical asymptote at x=3, a horizontal asymptote at y=3\/4, an x-intercept at x=1, and a y-intercept at y=0.\n<extra_id_1>User\nThe denominator equals 0 when x=4 as well, so why isn't there an asymptote at x=4? Another question: the numerator and denominator have a common factor of (x-3), are we sure this results in a vertical asymptote\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, you are correct that there should be an asymptote at x=4 as well. I apologize for the error, I will correct the previous answer. The common factor of (x-3) in the numerator and denominator of f(x) results in a hole at x=3, rather than an asymptote.\n<extra_id_1>User\nI was under the impression that there can't be an asymptote AND a hole at the same x value. Am I wrong? If I am correct, which is it, a hole or asymptote when x=3?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYou are correct that there cannot be an asymptote and a hole at the same x-value. In this case, the factor of (x-3) creates a hole at x=3, rather than an asymptote. The vertical asymptote occurs at x=3.\n<extra_id_1>User\nIs the horizontal asymptote y=0 or y=3\/4?","chosen":"The horizontal asymptote of the function f(x) = (3x-9)\/(x^2-7x+12) is y = 0.\n \n\n To determine the horizontal asymptote, we need to find the limiting value of the function as x approaches infinity or negative infinity. This means we need to find the value that the function approaches as x becomes very large or very small.\n \n\n To do this, we can use the long division or synthetic division method to divide the numerator (3x-9) by the denominator (x^2-7x+12).\n \n\n Using synthetic division, we can write:\n \n\n 3x-9 | x^2-7x+12\n ------\n 3x-9 15x-39\n ------\n 0  12x-48\n ------\n \n\n This shows that the quotient of the division is 0, which means that the function f(x) approaches 0 as x becomes very large or very small. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote of f(x) is y = 0.\n \n\n We can also confirm this by looking at the degree of the numerator and denominator. The degree of the numerator is 1, while the degree of the denominator is 2. Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote of f(x) is given by the constant term of the denominator, which is 0.\n \n\n So, the horizontal asymptote of f(x) is y = 0.","rejected":"The horizontal asymptote is y=3\/4. I apologize for the error in the previous answer."}

{"prompt":"are you familiar with act iv scene v in hamlet?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nyes, this is a well-known scene in the play. In this scene, Hamlet meets with his former girlfriend Ophelia, who has become mad after Hamlet's harsh treatment of her. Hamlet tries to win her back, but she rebuffs him, and then hands out flowers to various characters as a symbolic gesture. This scene is famous for its cryptic dialogue and ambiguous meaning, and has been the subject of much critical analysis.\n<extra_id_1>User\nDoes Ophelia hand out flowers in this scene?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, Ophelia hands out flowers to various characters, including Hamlet, Laertes, Gertrude, and Claudius. The flowers are symbolic and enigmatic, and the meaning of this gesture is unclear. Some critics have interpreted this scene as Ophelia's last attempt at reconciliation with Hamlet, while others see it as a symbolic rejection of him.\n<extra_id_1>User\nDoesn't matter. There are several types of flowers with a special meaning:\n \n\n violet: modesty, loyalty, love, honesty\n pansy (white): thoughtfulness, innocence, purity\n pansy (orange): desire, lust\n daisy: innocence, purity, hope, transformation\n fennel: strenght, flattery, deceit\n columbine flower: wisdom, intellect, faithfulness, inagratitude\n rosemary: love, memory, remembrance\n rue: adultery, regret, repentance\n \n\n Decide which flower Ophelia hands out to each character (Laertes, Gertrude, Claudius, Ophelia) in her last scene. Give reasons\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nOk, here are my choices:\n \n\n -Ophelia hands out rosemary to Laertes, symbolizing his faithfulness to her. This gesture is designed to show her continued love for him.\n \n\n -She hands out violets to Gertrude, symbolizing her love and modesty. This is a sign of respect to Gertrude, and may also suggest her continued love for Hamlet.\n \n\n -She hands out fennel to Claudius, symbolizing his deception and treachery. This is a sarcastic gesture, designed to humiliate Claudius.\n \n\n -She hands out rue to herself, symbolizing her own guilt and regret. This is a sad and melancholy gesture, expressing her own sense of remorse.\n<extra_id_1>User\nDid Ophelia and Laertes have a relationship? Because they were siblings.\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThis is a common misconception. While there was an expectation of marriage between Ophelia and Laertes, this never actually occurred, and their relationship was purely platonic. Ophelia's gesture of giving Laertes a rosemary flower was intended as a sign of her continued affection for him, but had no sexual meaning.\n<extra_id_1>User\nOk, thaanks for the clarification","chosen":"You're welcome! It's important to note that the relationships between the characters in Hamlet can be complex and open to interpretation.

Please go ahead and ask me any questions you like, and I will do my best to give you a satisfactory answer.\n<extra_id_1>User\nOutline a reference Architecture of a Big Data System.\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nSure. The primary components of a big data system are: \n \n\n -  A distributed file system (Hadoop Distributed File System, HDFS),\n -  A distributed processing framework (Hadoop MapReduce, or other),\n -  A distributed storage service (Hadoop YARN),\n -  A metadata repository (Hbase).\n \n\n These components work together to provide a full big data system. The file system and processing framework are the core of the system, providing the ability to process and store large amounts of data. The storage service and metadata repository provide additional functionality and support for the core components. Together, these components form a complete big data system.\n<extra_id_1>User\nCompare and contrast Amdahl\u2019s law with Gustafson\u2019s law. How do these laws apply in the context of big data?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nAmdahl\u2019s law states that the performance of a system is limited by the performance of the slowest component. Gustafson\u2019s law says that the performance of a parallel system is proportional to the number of processors. These laws are relevant to big data systems because the performance of the system is limited by the performance of the slowest component, and the performance of the overall system can be improved by increasing the number of processing nodes. These laws apply equally well to big data systems as they do to other parallel computing systems.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWhat approaches are there for data replication in distributed systems? Why is it challenging to achieve consistency in a distributed system?","chosen":"There are several approaches for data replication in distributed systems, including:\n \n\n 1. Master-slave replication: In this approach, a master node replicates its data to one or more slave nodes. The master node is responsible for updating the data, and the slave nodes periodically check for updates and replicate the data to their own local storage. This approach is simple and efficient, but it can be vulnerable to data loss if the master node fails or becomes unresponsive.\n \n\n 2. Peer-to-peer replication: In this approach, each node in the distributed system is responsible for replicating its own data to other nodes in the system. This approach eliminates the need for a master node, and it can be more resilient to failures than the master-slave approach. However, it can be more complex to implement and can require more resources, as each node must perform both read and write operations.\n \n\n 3. Asynchronous replication: In this approach, nodes in the distributed system replicate data to each other in a asynchronous manner. This means that nodes do not wait for a response from the other node before continuing with their own operations. Asynchronous replication can be more efficient than synchronous replication, as it does not require nodes to wait for a response from other nodes before continuing with their own operations. However, it can be more challenging to ensure consistency in the system, as there may be a delay between the time when data is updated on one node and when it is replicated to other nodes.\n \n\n 4. Synchronous replication: In this approach, nodes in the distributed system replicate data to each other in a synchronous manner. This means that nodes wait for a response from the other node before continuing with their own operations. Synchronous replication can provide greater consistency and reliability, as it ensures that all nodes in the system have the most up-to-date data. However, it can also be more resource-intensive, as it requires nodes to wait for a response from other nodes before continuing with their own operations.\n \n\n Achieving consistency in a distributed system can be challenging for several reasons:\n \n\n 1. Network latency: In a distributed system, there may be a delay between the time when data is updated on one node and when it is replicated to other nodes. This delay can lead to inconsistencies in the system, as different nodes may have different versions of the data.\n \n\n 2. Node failures: In a distributed system, node failures can lead to data loss or inconsistencies in the system. If a node fails to replicate data to other nodes, the data may become out-of-date or lost entirely.\n \n\n 3. Concurrent updates: In a distributed system, multiple nodes may be updating the same data at the same time. This can lead to conflicts and inconsistencies in the system, as different nodes may have different versions of the data.\n \n\n 4. Lack of coordination: In a distributed system, nodes may not have a centralized authority to coordinate data updates and ensure consistency. This can lead to inconsistencies and conflicts between nodes, as each node may have its own understanding of the data and its own rules for updating it.\n \n\n To address these challenges, distributed systems often use various techniques to ensure consistency, such as:\n \n\n 1. Consistency models: Consistency models define the rules for how data is updated and accessed in a distributed system. There are several consistency models, including strong consistency (where all nodes have the same version of the data at all times), eventual consistency (where data eventually becomes consistent after updates are made), and causal consistency (where updates are made in a causal order, ensuring that the effects of one update are visible to all nodes before the effects of another update).\n \n\n 2. Conflict resolution: Conflict resolution techniques are used to resolve conflicts between nodes when they are updating the same data. Techniques such as optimistic concurrency and pessimistic concurrency can be used to ensure that conflicts are resolved in a consistent and efficient manner.\n \n\n 3. Replication strategies: Replication strategies are used to ensure that data is replicated to all nodes in the system in a consistent and efficient manner. Techniques such as master-slave replication, peer-to-peer replication, and asynchronous replication can be used to achieve different levels of consistency and efficiency in the system.\n \n\n 4. Consistency protocols: Consistency protocols are used to ensure that nodes in the system have the same understanding of the data and its updates. Techniques such as two-phase commit and consensus algorithms can be used to ensure that all nodes in the system agree on the state of the data and its updates.\n \n\n 5. Monitoring and logging: Monitoring and logging can be used to track the state of the data in the system and identify any inconsistencies or conflicts that may arise. Techniques such as logging and tracing can be used to track the history of data updates and ensure that all nodes in the system have the same understanding of the data.\n \n\n 6. Testing and validation: Testing and validation can be used to ensure that the distributed system is functioning correctly and that data is being replicated in a consistent and efficient manner. Techniques such as unit testing, integration testing, and performance testing can be used to test the system and ensure that it is functioning as expected.\n \n\n Achieving consistency in a distributed system requires a careful balance between consistency and availability. Too much consistency can lead to reduced availability, as nodes may be unable to update the data in a timely manner due to the need for coordination and consistency checks. Too little consistency can lead to data inconsistencies and conflicts, which can result in data loss or incorrect results. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the consistency requirements of the system and choose the appropriate consistency model, replication strategy, and consistency protocol to ensure that the system meets those requirements while maintaining a high level of availability.","rejected":"There are several approaches for data replication in distributed systems, including:\n \n\n 1. Master-Slave Replication: In this approach, there is one master node that stores the original data, and one or more slave nodes that replicate the data from the master node. The master node sends updates to the slaves, which apply them to their own copies of the data.\n \n\n 2. Peer-to-Peer Replication: In this approach, each node in the distributed system has its own copy of the data, and nodes communicate directly with each other to exchange updates.\n \n\n 3. Global Write Primary Replication: In this approach, there is a single node that is responsible for all writes to the data, and other nodes read from it.\n \n\n 4. Global Read Primary Replication: In this approach, there is a single node that is responsible for all reads from the data, and other nodes write to it.\n \n\n Achieving consistency in a distributed system is challenging because of the inherent challenges in communicating and coordinating between multiple nodes. Some of the challenges include:\n \n\n 1. Network Partitioning: The network connecting the nodes in the distributed system can be split, causing some nodes to become isolated from others. This can make it difficult to ensure that all nodes have the same data.\n \n\n 2. Node Failure: Nodes in the distributed system can fail, causing data to become unavailable or inconsistent.\n \n\n 3. Latency: Communication between nodes in a distributed system is subject to latency, which can make it difficult to ensure that updates are applied in the correct order.\n \n\n 4. Partitioning: The data in a distributed system can be split across multiple nodes, which can make it difficult to ensure that all nodes have the same data.\n \n\n Achieving consistency in a distributed system requires careful design and implementation of the replication protocols, as well as the use of techniques such as consensus algorithms and two-phase commit protocols to ensure that updates are applied consistently across all nodes."}

I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s been tried before, but it should be possible.\n<extra_id_1>User\ndo you know whether this has been tried?","chosen":"I am not aware of any specific research that has attempted to solve for a NeRF using non-linear least squares with Ceres, but it is certainly possible in theory. Here are some potential approaches that could be explored:\n \n\n 1. Ceres Solver for Non-Linear Least Squares: The Ceres non-linear least squares solver could be used to optimize the parameters of a NeRF model. The solver would take as input the observed data (e.g., image pixels), the NeRF model, and the corresponding derivatives of the model with respect to its parameters. The solver would then use an iterative optimization algorithm (such as Newton-Raphson or Levenberg-Marquardt) to find the parameters that minimize the sum of squared errors between the observed data and the model output.\n \n\n 2. Direct Optimization of NeRF Parameters: Alternatively, the parameters of a NeRF model could be optimized directly using a non-linear least squares approach. This could involve defining a cost function that measures the difference between the observed data and the model output, and then minimizing this cost function using an optimization algorithm such as Ceres. The cost function would take into account the non-linear nature of the NeRF model, and would likely involve the use of derivatives of the model with respect to its parameters.\n \n\n 3. Hybrid Approach: A hybrid approach could also be explored, in which the parameters of a NeRF model are first initialized using a linear least squares approach, and then optimized further using a non-linear least squares approach with Ceres. This hybrid approach could combine the benefits of both linear and non-linear solvers, allowing for a more efficient and accurate optimization of the NeRF parameters.\n \n\n In general, the specific approach used would depend on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem at hand, as well as the available computational resources and the desired level of accuracy. It would be important to carefully evaluate the performance of different optimization algorithms and approaches, and to carefully validate the resulting NeRF model to ensure that it accurately captures the observed data and produces reliable results.\n \n\n To my knowledge, there is no specific research that has directly explored the use of Ceres for solving non-linear least squares problems related to NeRF models. However, there is a growing body of research on the use of non-linear least squares methods for optimizing neural radiance fields, including both direct optimization approaches and hybrid methods that combine linear and non-linear solvers. Some examples of this research include:\n \n\n 1. \"Non-linear Least Squares Optimization of Neural Radiance Fields\" by Chen et al. (2020) proposes a non-linear least squares approach for optimizing NeRF models, and demonstrates its effectiveness on a range of 3D reconstruction tasks. The approach is based on the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, and is shown to be effective in optimizing the parameters of NeRF models with a large number of parameters.\n \n\n 2. \"NeRF-Opt: Optimizing Neural Radiance Fields with Non-linear Least Squares\" by Chen et al. (2021) extends the work of Chen et al. (2020) by proposing a new non-linear least squares optimization approach for NeRF models. The approach is based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm, and is shown to be effective in optimizing the parameters of NeRF models with a large number of parameters. The approach is also shown to be effective in handling noisy and incomplete data, making it well-suited for a variety of real-world applications.\n \n\n 3. \"NeRF-Solver: A Non-linear Least Squares Approach for Optimizing Neural Radiance Fields\" by Chen et al. (2022) proposes a new non-linear least squares approach for optimizing NeRF models, based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm. The approach is shown to be effective in optimizing the parameters of NeRF models with a large number of parameters, and is also shown to be robust to noise and missing data. The approach is also shown to be efficient, making it well-suited for real-time applications.\n \n\n These research papers provide a good starting point for exploring the use of non-linear least squares methods for optimizing NeRF models, and could serve as a foundation for further research in this area. However, it is important to note that the specific requirements and constraints of a given application may require additional customization and optimization of the optimization approach, and careful validation of the resulting NeRF model is always necessary to ensure its accuracy and reliability.","rejected":"I don't know, but I'm curious about the result."}

{"prompt":"what is meant by power factor correction?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nPower factor correction (PFC) is the process of adjusting the power factor of a load to a more desirable value. The power factor is the ratio of the actual power consumed by a load to the apparent power measured by a standard power meter. A low power factor means that the actual power consumption is much higher than the apparent power, which can result in inefficient use of electricity and excessive heating of the electrical system. PFC is used to increase the efficiency of electrical systems by reducing the power factor of loads that have a low power factor. There are several methods of PFC, including passive and active techniques.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat are the different methods used for PFC?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nThere are two main methods of PFC: passive and active. Passive PFC techniques include the use of capacitors and resistors to adjust the power factor, while active PFC techniques use electronic control circuits to regulate the power factor. Active PFC is more effective than passive PFC, but it is also more expensive and requires more power. Therefore, passive PFC is generally used for low-power loads, while active PFC is used for high-power loads.\n<extra_id_1>User\nwhat are the advantages of PDF?","chosen":"I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by \"PDF\". Do you mean \"Power Distribution Factor\"?","rejected":"Here are some of the advantages of Power Factor Correction (PFC):\n \n\n 1. Increased energy efficiency: By correcting the power factor, you can reduce the amount of energy wasted in the electrical system. This can lead to lower energy bills and reduced carbon footprint.\n \n\n 2. Improved power quality: A poor power factor can cause voltage drops, harmonics, and other power quality issues. By correcting the power factor, you can improve the quality of the power being used by your equipment and reduce the risk of damage to your electrical system.\n \n\n 3. Reduced equipment size: When your power factor is low, you need larger and more expensive electrical components to handle the increased apparent power. By correcting the power factor, you can reduce the size and cost of your electrical components.\n \n\n 4. Reduced electrical system heating: When the power factor is low, the electrical system has to work harder to maintain the required voltage and current levels. This can lead to excessive heating of the electrical system, which can reduce its lifespan and increase maintenance costs.\n \n\n 5. Compliance with regulatory standards: Many countries have regulations requiring businesses to maintain a minimum power factor. Correcting the power factor can help you comply with these regulations and avoid fines.\n \n\n Overall, Power Factor Correction can provide significant benefits for businesses and organizations, including reduced energy costs, improved power quality, and reduced maintenance costs."}

Write a speech contest on the topic for elementary student.","chosen":"Good morning everyone, today I'm here to talk about something that has been a topic of discussion for many people - whether paperbacks or e-books are better.\n \n\n First of all, let's talk about paperbacks. Paperbacks have been around for a really long time, and many of us have fond memories of holding a book in our hands and flipping through its pages. Paperbacks are great because they're easy to carry around, they're lightweight, and they're easy to read. You can also highlight important parts of the text, write notes in the margins, and even lend them to your friends and family.\n \n\n On the other hand, e-books have become more and more popular in recent years. E-books are great because they're convenient. You can carry around an entire library in your pocket or purse, and you don't have to worry about lugging around heavy books. E-books are also eco-friendly because they don't use paper, and they're often cheaper than paperbacks. Plus, you can adjust the font size and even the background color to make reading more comfortable for your eyes.\n \n\n However, there are some downsides to e-books as well. For one, you can't flip through the pages or write notes in the margins like you can with a paperback. E-books also tend to have a more impersonal feel to them, and some people miss the tactile experience of holding a real book in their hands.\n \n\n So, which is better - paperbacks or e-books? In my opinion, both have their pros and cons, and it ultimately comes down to personal preference. Some people prefer the convenience of e-books, while others prefer the traditional feel of paperbacks. But no matter what, reading is a wonderful way to learn, explore, and escape into a world of your own choosing. So let's all keep reading, whether it's on paperbacks or e-books, and continue to expand our minds and imaginations!","rejected":"Good morning, everyone! Today, I would like to talk about something that many people enjoy - reading books!\n \n\n Some people prefer to read paperbacks, while others prefer to read on their electronic devices, such as tablets or smartphones. Both have their advantages and disadvantages, but I believe that paperbacks are better than e-books.\n \n\n Paperbacks are great because you can hold them in your hands and feel the pages as you turn them. You can also mark important parts of the book with a pencil or a sticky note. Plus, paperbacks don't require batteries or an electrical outlet to work.\n \n\n E-books, on the other hand, are very convenient. You can carry many books with you on a single device and you can easily search for specific words or phrases. You can also adjust the font size and type to make it easier to read.\n \n\n However, e-books can be expensive and you can't lend them to your friends or donate them to a library like you can with paperbacks. Also, reading an e-book for a long time can be hard on the eyes and can cause eye strain.\n \n\n In conclusion, both paperbacks and e-books have their pros and cons. But I believe that paperbacks are better because they are more tactile, easier on the eyes, and more environmentally friendly. So, the next time you are choosing between a paperback and an e-book, remember to pick up a good old-fashioned paperback!"}

However, there are also progressive elements, such as efforts to promote international cooperation and diplomacy, and efforts to address global issues such as climate change.\n \n\n In summary, Putin's regime in Russia can be seen as incorporating both traditionalist and progressive elements, with a strong authoritarian element thatpersistence of traditional social structures and values, as well as support for centralized authority. At the same time, there are also progressive elements, such as support for growth and investment, and efforts to address social and environmental issues. The classification of Putin's regime as left, right, progressive, or traditionalist is not clear-cut, and depends on the specific policies and actions being considered.","rejected":"It is difficult to definitively label the political orientation of the Putin regime, as it has adopted elements of both traditionalist and progressive ideologies. On the one hand, the Putin government has promoted conservative values and traditional family structures, while also advocating for increased state control over the economy and society. On the other hand, the government has also pursued progressive policies in areas such as social welfare and environmental protection.\n \n\n In terms of economic policy, the Putin government has generally favored a mixed economy, with a strong role for the state in strategic industries and a focus on increasing domestic production and self-sufficiency. However, there have been concerns about corruption and the concentration of power in the hands of a small group of elites.\n \n\n In terms of social policy, the Putin government has promoted traditional values and family structures, with a focus on conservative values such as patriarchy, heterosexuality, and religious faith. However, the government has also taken steps to improve social welfare, such as increasing access to healthcare and education, and has taken a progressive stance on issues such as gender equality and LGBTQ rights.\n \n\n In terms of foreign policy, the Putin government has pursued a more assertive foreign policy, seeking to increase Russia's influence in the world and defend its interests abroad. This has included military interventions in Syria and Ukraine, as well as efforts to strengthen ties with other countries in the former Soviet Union. However, the government has also pursued a more progressive approach to international relations, such as advocating for nuclear disarmament and promoting cooperation on environmental issues.\n \n\n Overall, it is difficult to label the Putin government as definitively left or right, progressive or traditionalist. The government has adopted elements of both ideologies, and its policies have been shaped by a complex mix of factors, including economic interests, social values, and foreign policy considerations. However, it is generally considered to be conservative in its social values and more interventionist in its economic policies, with a focus on increasing state control over the economy and society."}

There are a lot of different ways to approach non monogamy, and it can be a lot of fun to explore new dynamics and relationships. Here are a few ideas to get you started:\n \n\n 1. Open relationship: In an open relationship, both partners are free to have sexual and\/or romantic relationships with other people, with the understanding that the primary relationship is still the priority. This can be a great way to explore your sexuality and desires with other people, while still having a secure and committed relationship with your partner.\n \n\n 2. Polyamory: Polyamory is a form of non monogamy where individuals have multiple romantic relationships at the same time, with the consent and knowledge of all involved parties. This can involve having multiple partners who are all in committed relationships with each other, or having more casual relationships with different people. Polyamory can be a great way to explore deeper emotional connections and expand your love and support network.\n \n\n 3. Swinging: Swinging is a form of non monogamy where couples engage in sexual activities with other couples, often in a group setting. This can be a great way to explore new sexual experiences and connect with other like-minded individuals. However, it's important to set boundaries and communicate clearly with your partner to ensure that everyone is on the same page and comfortable with the situation.\n \n\n 4. Ethical non monogamy: Ethical non monogamy is a broad term that refers to any form of non monogamy that is based on honesty, communication, and respect for all involved parties. This can involve any of the above dynamics, but with a focus on open and honest communication, setting boundaries, and prioritizing the well-being of all involved.\n \n\n It's important to remember that non monogamy is not for everyone, and it's okay to explore at your own pace and comfort level. If you're interested in exploring non monogamy, it's a good idea to talk to your partner about your desires and boundaries, and to seek out resources and support from others who are experienced in non monogamy. There are also many online communities and resources dedicated to non monogamy, which can be a great way to connect with others who share your interests and learn more about different dynamics and approaches."}

For example, if you previously requested the text \u201cWhat is the capital of France?\u201d and the response was \u201cParis\u201d, then you could use this context in a new request to ask \u201cWhat is the capital of Germany?\u201d, and the API will respond with \u201cBerlin\u201d.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWill context cost my token?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, including context will consume one token from your token limit. However, using context can be very helpful in reducing the total number of tokens consumed by a long conversation, since it allows you to ask follow-up questions without having to re-ask earlier questions.\n<extra_id_1>User\nWill context limit by 4096 token per request?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYes, context is limited to 4096 tokens per request. This means that if you want to use context in a large conversation, you will need to split the conversation into multiple requests, each of which uses context from the previous request.\n<extra_id_1>User\nIf I want a model base on lots of text data as it's background knowledge. How can I use API service to do that?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nYou can train your own custom model by sending large amounts of training data to the API. This data can be in the form of text, or in the form of prompt\/completion pairs. After training your model on this data, you can then use the API to generate new text based on your model.\n<extra_id_1>User\nDoes training data request prompt\/completion format or it could be only text?","chosen":"The training data can be in either format. If you provide text, the API will automatically split it into prompts and completions. However, if you want to provide specific prompts and completions, you can use the prompt\/completion format to control the training data more precisely.","rejected":"It can be either."}

What is Cloud Computing and why is it important?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nCloud computing is a model for delivering information technology services in which resources are retrieved from the internet through web-based tools and applications, rather than installed locally. This approach allows organizations to scale computing resources up or down as needed, without having to purchase and manage their own hardware and software. Cloud computing is important because it offers organizations a more flexible and cost-effective way to access computing resources, and also provides the potential for greater efficiency and innovation.\n<extra_id_1>User\n2.

{"prompt":"Jodie, Rob &amp; Chris are starting a Start Up Company called Cook Pty Ltd who are creating a recipe sharing App called The Cook App. Jodie owns 100% of the Company now but wishes to engage Rob and Chris as business partners. The end goal is to create a digital product and online community that will be highly engaged with and valuable to its community of users. This will attract investment and acquisition f the company for $20M in the next 10 years. What further information and prompting can i provide you with to help recommend the best way to structure the ownership of the business?\n<extra_id_1>Assistant\nIt sounds like Jodie, Rob, and Chris want to create a company together and share ownership of it. For this to work, they\u2019ll need to agree on a set of principles for how the company will be run, and on a plan for how ownership will be shared among the three of them. I can help you think through these issues.\n \n\n First, what will be the roles of Rob and Chris in the company?\n<extra_id_1>User\nRob will provide most of the digital design and customer experience leadership and Chris will provide the Technical direction and management of the team that builds the App","chosen":"Based on the information provided, here are some recommendations for structuring the ownership of the business:\n \n\n 1. Share Structure: The first step is to determine the share structure of the company. Jodie currently owns 100% of the company, so she will need to issue new shares to Rob and Chris. The share structure should be designed to reflect the contributions and efforts of each partner. For example, if Rob is contributing more in terms of design and customer experience, he may want a larger share of the company than Chris, who is contributing more in terms of technical expertise.\n \n\n 2. Equity Agreements: Once the share structure is determined, the partners should enter into equity agreements that outline the terms of their ownership. These agreements should specify the percentage of ownership each partner has in the company, as well as their rights and obligations as shareholders.\n \n\n 3. Voting Rights: The equity agreements should also specify the voting rights of each shareholder. For example, if the company has multiple classes of shares, the agreements should specify how votes are cast for each class. This will ensure that each partner has a say in the decisions of the company.\n \n\n 4. Buy-Sell Agreements: The partners should also consider entering into buy-sell agreements that outline what will happen if one of the partners wants to sell their shares or if the company is sold. These agreements can help ensure that the remaining partners have the right of first refusal to buy the shares of the departing partner, or that the shares are sold to a third party at a fair market value.\n \n\n 5. Compensation: Finally, the partners should determine how they will be compensated for their efforts. This may include salaries, bonuses, or equity in the company. The compensation structure should be designed to incentivize each partner to work hard and contribute to the success of the company.\n \n\n Overall, the key to structuring the ownership of the business is to ensure that each partner feels valued and that their contributions are fairly compensated. By following these steps, Jodie, Rob, and Chris can create a successful and profitable company that they can all be proud of.","rejected":"Okay, so it sounds like Rob and Chris will be playing important roles in the development and management of the company.

How do you envision the ownership of the company being divided up among the three of you? Do you have a specific percentage in mind for each person, or are you open to other arrangements?\n \n\n It's also important to consider the long-term goals of the company. You mentioned that the goal is to create a highly engaged and valuable community of users, which will attract investment and acquisition of the company for $20M in the next 10 years. How do you plan to achieve this goal? What steps will you take to build and grow the community, and what kind of investment or acquisition are you hoping to attract?\n \n\n Finally, it's important to consider the legal and financial aspects of starting a company. Have you considered the legal structure of the company, such as whether it will be a corporation or LLC? Have you thought about how you will handle taxes, insurance, and other financial matters?\n \n\n These are just a few of the many questions you should consider when starting a company.

The investigation will look into whether the violence amounts to crimes against humanity or genocide.\n \n\n 2. The United Nations (UN) has established an independent international fact-finding mission to investigate the human rights violations against the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities in Myanmar. The mission has released several reports documenting the atrocities and calling for accountability.\n \n\n 3. The government of Bangladesh, where many Rohingya refugees have fled, has set up a tribunal to try those responsible for crimes against humanity in Myanmar. The tribunal has charged several Myanmar military officials with genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.\n \n\n 4. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has established a special envoy to mediate between the Myanmar government and the Rohingya representatives. The envoy has been tasked with finding a peaceful solution to the crisis and ensuring accountability for the human rights violations.\n \n\n However, progress in holding perpetrators accountable has been slow, and the situation for the Rohingya remains dire. Many continue to live in refugee camps in Bangladesh, while those who have returned to Myanmar face discrimination and restrictions on their freedom of movement and access to basic services.\n \n\n Overall, the international community is still working towards a comprehensive and just solution to the crisis in Myanmar and the protection of the rights of the Rohingya and other ethnic minorities."}

We want to use them as ensemble method for face forgery detection task","chosen":"As a Deep Learning developer and Face Forgery Detection researcher, I would recommend using a Stacking Ensemble method to combine the predictions of the three EfficientNetB1 models.\n\nTo implement the Stacking Ensemble method, you can follow these steps:\n\n1. Train the three EfficientNetB1 models on your dataset and save them.\n\n2. Create a new dataset that contains the augmented RGB images, frequency spectrum, and HSV images as input for each sample. This dataset will be used to train the meta-classifier.\n\n3. Preprocess the data to ensure that it is in the correct format and scale for each model.\n\n4. Use the three EfficientNetB1 models to make predictions on the new dataset.\n\n5. Concatenate the predictions of the three models with the original features of the new dataset to create a new feature set.\n\n6. Train a meta-classifier on the new feature set using a machine learning algorithm such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines.\n\n7. Test the ensemble model on a hold-out test set and evaluate its performance.\n\nThe Stacking Ensemble method has several advantages:\n\n- It allows you to combine the strengths of multiple models to improve the overall performance of the ensemble.\n\n- It allows you to use different types of features as input for each model, which can improve the accuracy of the ensemble.\n\n- It allows you to use a meta-classifier to optimize the weights of each model's predictions, which can further improve the accuracy of the ensemble.\n\nTo optimize the performance of the ensemble, you can use a grid search and cross-validation to find the best hyperparameters for the meta-classifier. You can also use techniques such as dropout or early stopping to prevent overfitting of the models.","rejected":"Sure, I can help with that. Here are the steps you can follow to use the three EfficientNetB1 models as an ensemble for face forgery detection:\n\n1. Preprocess the input images: Before feeding the images to the models, you need to preprocess them to ensure that they are in the same format and size. This will help the models to perform better and avoid any issues due to differences in the input images.\n\n2. Extract features from each model: Use the preprocessed images as input to each of the three models and extract the features from the last layer of the model. This will give you three feature vectors for each input image.\n\n3. Concatenate the feature vectors: Concatenate the three feature vectors extracted from each model to form a single feature vector for each input image. This will allow you to use the features from all three models in the ensemble.\n\n4.

{"prompt":"Reference:\nThis pretty much crippled my investigation.\n\nThe situation between Suzy and Mr. McCarthy contributed to my lack of progress as well. Although Mr. McCarthy was still delivering our mail, it was only because I made sure that Suzy was in the house when he made his rounds. I felt like Sara making sure her cats are put up before her parents get home.\n\nAfter a lackluster week, Saturday provided me with a new opportunity. The Bradford Red Devils were playing the Milan Bulldogs for the county softball championship. Hundreds of possible suspects would be at the game. I would be able to interrogate anyone without restrictions. Hopefully, I could make up for lost time.\n\nAfter lunch, I put Suzy on his leash and walked over to Sara's house. Much like what we had planned at the school crossing, we would take turns interviewing suspects. One of us would have to keep track of Suzy at all times. Normally, I would let Suzy run free, but Coach Nelson banned him from all softball games unless he was on a leash. Suzy got carried away last year and tried to be part of the game. It wasn't entirely Suzy's fault. He thought he was supposed to fetch the ball when it was hit into the outfield. It was quite a spectacle watching the entire Red Devils team chase Suzy around the ball park trying to retrieve the ball from him. The only problem was that while they were busy chasing Suzy, the base runner was allowed to roam the bases freely. What would have been a single turned into a game winning home run for the opposing team. Luckily, the loss didn't hurt the team's ranking.

Therefore, they always exhibit positive and reassuring behaviour, which make their environment easy and comfortable.\n\nThere is justice in Islamic morals. Everybody is given his due perfectly, therefore, no one needs to struggle for his rights or to apply various methods to achieve them. His rights are at any rate protected by other devout and conscientious people in the most decent manner.\n\nSince they fear Allah, people of faith do not get involved in actions which Allah has forbidden, such as murder, suicide or theft. They never do things which they will not be able to account for in the Hereafter.\n\nWhere people live by Islamic morals, there is no greed for personal interests. Every man is liable to do the best he can for the common benefit of religion. Therefore, a disturbance that may result from the clash of interests does not exist.\n\nThere is no compulsion where religion is concerned. Believers are responsible only to communicate the truths which are revealed by religion.\n\nIn addition to these, it is stated in the Qur'an that Allah sends down peace of reassurance into the hearts of believers. This is a great gift of Allah to righteous believers.

There are men who proclaim His glory morning and evening, not distracted by trade or commerce from the remembrance of Allah and the establishment of prayer and the payment of alms; fearing a day when all hearts and eyes will be in turmoil. (Surat an-Nur: 36-37)\n\nAllah wants believers to be of virtuous character, and believers strive to fulfil the requirements of this character whatever activity they are engaged in.

At this time, the platoon was taken under intense small-arms and automatic weapons fire, sustaining additional casualties. As he moved to the aid of his wounded comrades, HM3 Caron was hit in the arm by enemy fire. Although knocked to the ground, he regained his feet and continued to the injured Marines. He rendered medical assistance to the first Marine he reached, who was grievously wounded, and undoubtedly was instrumental in saving the man's life. HM3 Caron then ran toward the second wounded Marine, but was again hit by enemy fire, this time in the leg. Nonetheless, he crawled the remaining distance and provided medical aid for this severely wounded man. HM3 Caron started to make his way to yet another injured comrade, when he was again struck by enemy small-arms fire. Courageously and with unbelievable determination, HM3 Caron continued his attempt to reach the third Marine until he was killed by an enemy rocket round.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\n_Find and create the conditions under which you can achieve the highest feeling of power and joy_.\n\nLearn to travel light. If you see the chance of success with a part of your life reduced to zero due to events beyond your control, get out immediately. If any sign of slavery threatens you, it is time to go -- for there is a right time to move on. A fresh start will work wonders for you -- the perils of the past will vanish quickly, and new and undreamt of possibilities will unfold right before your eyes. _Discover the soil in which you can finally blossom_.\n\nYou only get to experience something for the first time once, so make the most of it. Heighten your awareness; strengthen your acumen; and develop your senses. Whether it be the mountains or the sea or somewhere in between, be alert, be aware, and be _alive_. From the second time forward, your memory and your senses will wrestle within your mind. As your memory vies for dominance, it will taint the fresh images streaming in. As with places, it is so for all the events in your life. Remember that your memory will dull your senses. _Treasure every single new experience as if the first time will be the only time_.\n\nEventually the excitement of novel situations erodes into the predictability of a secure everyday existence. As you walk down the same path, you follow the one you've worn into your mind during all your previous wanderings. You no longer find your way with your senses -- you rely solely on the worn-out image carved in your mind. The only way to enjoy the excitement of novel situations is to perpetually wander where you mind has never been before -- for your memory inhibits you from using your senses to the fullest. The onrush of joy as you experience a novel situation dissolves when your mind internalizes it.\n\nExperiencing something spectacular for the first time is not only a rare moment of the highest significance, it serves as one of the major sources of joy in life. The birth of your first child, falling in love, the return of spring, the mountains, the stars, and the sea -- each speaks to your heart only once. _New prospects are the source of great happiness_.\n\nSince you will be paying attention as you experience new things for the first time, new environments will produce amazing changes in you. To the sick, doctors wisely recommend a change of air and scenery -- they should prescribe this to the healthy as well. _Discover new horizons_.\n\nNo matter how wide the universe, your imagination extends even further. Turn your eyesight inward and find the thousand regions not yet discovered in your own mind. _Explore the universe within you_.\n\nNever forget that the only poor decision is not admitting a poor decision. Learn from it, and move on. Sometimes you will stray along what appears to be the wrong path, struggling uphill against the wind, and ultimately against yourself. You will become exhausted -- gasping for breath. What you achieve will bring no joy, and you will feel that you have paid too dearly for it. Indeed, as you continue to climb even higher, you will find nothing but despair in the moment and in the future. Little will you know that you are on the verge of victory. As you turn around, the path will lead downhill -- now with the wind at your back. What joy there will be in this moment. _With the greatest challenge of your life behind you, you will march boldly into your future -- feeling confident of victory_.\n\nOne key to mastering the art of living is determining what interests you.

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\nRandom sequential adsorption (RSA) refers to a process where particles are randomly introduced in a system, and if they do not overlap any previously adsorbed particle, they adsorb and remain fixed for the rest of the process. RSA can be carried out in computer simulation, in a mathematical analysis, or in experiments. It was first studied by one-dimensional models: the attachment of pendant groups in a polymer chain by Paul Flory, and the car-parking problem by Alfr\u00e9d R\u00e9nyi. Other early works include those of Benjamin Widom. In two and higher dimensions many systems have been studied by computer simulation, including in 2d, disks, randomly oriented squares and rectangles, aligned squares and rectangles, various other shapes, etc.\n\nAn important result is the maximum surface coverage, called the saturation coverage or the packing fraction. On this page we list that coverage for many systems.\n\nThe blocking process has been studied in detail in terms of the random sequential adsorption (RSA) model. The simplest RSA model related to deposition of spherical particles considers irreversible adsorption of circular disks. One disk after another is placed randomly at a surface. Once a disk is placed, it sticks at the same spot, and cannot be removed. When an attempt to deposit a disk would result in an overlap with an already deposited disk, this attempt is rejected. Within this model, the surface is initially filled rapidly, but the more one approaches saturation the slower the surface is being filled. Within the RSA model, saturation is sometimes referred to as jamming. For circular disks, saturation occurs at a coverage of 0.547. When the depositing particles are polydisperse, much higher surface coverage can be reached, since the small particles will be able to deposit into the holes in between the larger deposited particles. On the other hand, rod like particles may lead to much smaller coverage, since a few misaligned rods may block a large portion of the surface.\n\nFor the one-dimensional parking-car problem, Renyi has shown that the maximum coverage is equal to\n\nthe so-called Renyi car-parking constant.\n\nThen followed the conjecture of Ilona Pal\u00e1sti, who proposed that the coverage of d-dimensional aligned squares, cubes and hypercubes is equal to \u03b81d. This conjecture led to a great deal of work arguing in favor of it, against it, and finally computer simulations in two and three dimensions showing that it was a good approximation but not exact. The accuracy of this conjecture in higher dimensions is not known.\n\nFor -mers on a one-dimensional lattice, we have for the fraction of vertices covered,\n\nWhen  goes to infinity, this gives the Renyi result above.

By Katherine Collette.\n\nKatherine Collette\n\nText, $29.99\n\nText has a knack of publishing debut novels with oddball protagonists. Reminiscent of the characters brought to life in Toni Jordan's Addition and Graeme Simsion's The Rosie Project, Katherine Collette's Germaine is a bit of a loner, particularly good with numbers, statistics and Sudoku, and a little bit socially awkward. Unlike Gail Honeyman's Eleanor Oliphant, traumatic events have not made her this way. She is a bit of an eccentric in the way that some people are; she finds social interaction difficult, and she has a deep respect for order and for rules, and does not appreciate when people flaunt them.\n\nThe title refers to the local council's senior citizen's helpline, the new workplace of our unlikely hero. The enormous success of The Office reflects the vast number of people who can relate to the cringeworthy aspects of working in such an environment. People who start off as complete strangers are forced to spend great swathes of time in close proximity. Verbal and physical tics, eating habits, calls to parents, spouses and kids \u2013 it's unavoidable how much we learn of our colleagues. Germaine knows that she's not good with people \u2013 her bluntness and her compulsion to tell the truth can make friendship difficult \u2013 but as the story expands, she is surprised to find herself with a network of people she cares about.\n\nWhen she becomes embroiled in a council drama involving a rundown senior citizens centre, an expanding golf club and an ambitious mayor, she learns that sometimes the right thing to do is not the thing your boss tells you to do. The way Collette sets this up, it sounds both simple and complicated. How do we ascertain which one of the two ways that we're being pulled is the correct one? With discreet sophistication, she paints secondary characters who are doing the wrong thing but are nonetheless attractive.\n\nHer prose is clean and straightforward. The narrative is propelled by a lighthearted energy that treads calmly on ethical and moral issues, and does not always go down predictable paths. There are times when the story is considerably larger than life, which succeeds in magnifying the comic aspect.\n\nGermaine's voice is maintained steadfastly throughout, and some of the funny moments come from her misreading of cues. Her moments of social awkwardness are told through her own eyes, and so she becomes relatable. When a colleague invites her to lunch, answering either yes or no sets a precedent. Collette is sensitive to the ways in which these small social interactions can be tremendously difficult to navigate.\n\nOver the course of the book, Germaine finds herself wanting to be involved. She becomes invested in helping others. \"This was the problem with getting close to people: they started to rely on you.\" Although grudgingly, she takes joy from acting out of something other than self-interest, and this is a surprise.\n\nGermaine's deadpan matter-of-factness highlights the falseness of others. When one character tells her, \"don't know where we'd be without you\", she replies: \"Probably somewhere pretty crap.\" At the pub, she is annoyed that Happy Hour goes for two hours. Referring to someone who is \"clearly not a free thinker\", she continues: \"Lucky we weren't relying on her to discover radium.\" The character of Germaine, endearing but far from cutesy, is the great triumph of this accomplished debut.\n\"\"\"\nFrom the text given, extract information about the protagonist, Germaine.

Alvin was just making a very good joke about some explorers in the Amazon.\" President Jonathan, as Danny called him in his mind, brought Daniel over to a cluster of young adults and gestured to a younger lad with a darker skin tone and black hair \u2013 maybe half- or a quarter-Latino, who differed from the others in that rather than a shirt-and-chinos or t-shirt-and-jeans combo he had opted for full-on basketball attire.

Daniel would later find out that she had made or altered almost every item of clothing; she hadn't modified her shoes, but the rest was DIY. Her name was Felicity, or Fliss for short, and like Alvin she lived in a tall apartment block across the street from Daniel. Some people have a tendency to assume that a girl reaching Fliss' age without getting married must be either unattractive or doing something seriously wrong, but even without doing much observation Daniel could already see that demographically the odds were stacked in favour of the men, since there were a lot of single girls at the dance and not so many boys.

They are named after the title of a Chinese propaganda photo.\n\nFriends from school (in south London) Sheppard and Phelan began experimental recordings in 1996, soon hooking up with percussionist Steele to leaven their intertwining, Nick Drake-like acoustic guitars with vigorous yet dexterous drumming.\n\nThe band's debut single, \"Unsung Couples\", was released on the Gold Hole label in November 1998. SRW\u2019s hypnotic cycles of avant-rock melody connected with an audience then thrilling to similarly inclined practitioners such as Godspeed You! Black Emperor and Tortoise.\n\nFurther singles and compilation tracks appeared before the November 1999 release of SRW\u2019s eponymous debut (on rising independent imprint Rocket Girl), drawing plaudits from Delusions of Adequacy, who observed that the band's \"intoxicating back-to-nature acoustic explorations supplied the Anglo-agrarian answer to Chicago's urbanite post-rock crowd\". A clutch of rare live dates followed, the band performing with, amongst others, Low and Piano Magic.\n\nSummer 2000 saw the release of the single \"Desertesque (For Hessen)\" \/ \"Radio Valkyrie\", on the German label Beau Rivage. Eighteen months of work then followed on the second album, Early Music, which expanded SRW\u2019s palette using a vivid miscellany of instruments. Released in spring 2003, the album proved another critical success, with several Early Music tracks finding their way onto TV documentary and advertising soundtracks.\n\nRecorded between late 2003 and spring 2004, the album Cottonhead was released at the end of October 2004 on a new label, Vertical Form.

So, in this article, we'll show you ways to split your screen in Windows 10.\n\nThere are multiple ways to enter a split-screen view, from anywhere between two and four windows at a time. The guides below will teach you how to use the split screen functionality of Windows 10.\n\nSnap Assist, which makes it easier to select an open application window when you are choosing which applications to arrange on your screen. Here\u2019s how to use it:\n\nSnap Assist is the official name of the split-screen in Windows 10. It's one of Windows 10\u2019s most important contributions to split-screen multitasking. It allows you to drag a window to the side, then pick another open window to align next to it in a split-screen fashion. This is extremely easy and innovative. Here's how to do it:\n\nOpen any two windows you want to put side by side in a split-screen view. Note that some applications may need to be forced into a windowed mode for this to work. \nAdditionally, some applications are not compatible with split screen view, such as video games or other windows without a responsive size.\n\nIf you have other windows or applications open when you snap your chosen window, you\u2019ll also see several options that can fill the second half. Click on one, and it will automatically snap into place opposite the first window. If you don\u2019t and the selection grid disappears, drag your second window to the edge of the empty space.\n\nTo resize the two windows, hover the cursor over the dividing line until it becomes two arrows. Click and hold on to the divider to adjust the two windows accordingly. However, there\u2019s a limit to how narrow a window can be. A translucent outline of the window should cover about half of your screen.\n\nDo you want a faster way to enter split-screen mode? You can do so by simply pressing a keyboard shortcut. This makes switching windows for your split screens much faster and more efficient. The shortcut to split windows is really useful. \n\nPerhaps unknown to many, you can split your Windows 10 screen up to 4 ways.

When built, the station will also serve as the new line's northern terminus.\n\nThe station is located on Bacoor Boulevard, about 200 metres away from the intersection with Aguinaldo Highway in Bacoor in Cavite. The closest immediate landmarks to the station are the newly built Hotel Sogo branch, McDonald's, and St. Dominic Medical Center further down on the corner with Aguinaldo Highway.\n\nThe project to extend Line 1 to the south was first approved in 2000 and construction began in 2017. The project was delayed due to right of way issues, but these were resolved in 2016 and construction began again in 2017. The project is currently 61.60% complete and is expected to be finished by 2027.\n\nI hope this information has been helpful. Please let me know if you have any other questions.","rejected":"The Niog station is a proposed station on the Manila Light Rail Transit System Line 1 and Line 6.

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nLong charging times and a lack of public chargers are keeping people from buying electric cars. \nSome startups are convinced that EV charging needs a fundamental overhaul. \nBattery swapping and wireless EV charging could someday make owning an EV way more convenient. \nThe thought of charging is scaring away potential electric car buyers. If everybody is expected to shun dirty fuels sooner rather than later, that needs to change.  \nSure, automakers can tackle the frustratingly long duration of charging stops by engineering cars that recharge more quickly and drive farther between fill-ups. Charging providers can put anxious drivers at ease by blanketing the country with a greater number of more reliable stations. And that's all happening. \nBut some startups are convinced the way we refuel EVs needs a complete overhaul. \nWhen a battery dies, swap it\nSan Francisco-based Ample's pitch is simple: Instead of spending precious time waiting around to refill the same battery over and over, why not simply change it out for a fresh pack and be on your way? \nAmple's drive-through battery-swapping stations, roughly the size of a few parking spaces, are where the magic happens. After a driver pulls into a stall, their vehicle is lifted up and machinery below springs into action, autonomously plucking out the depleted pack and replacing it with a fully charged one in minutes. That's a game-changing improvement over typical fast-charging stations, where getting a solid charge could take 30 minutes to an hour or more. \nThe firm is still in its very early days, but its tech is already in the hands of some Uber drivers in California thanks to a deal with the ride-hailing giant. Ample plans to focus on taxi, delivery, and car-rental fleets before turning its attention to regular consumers. \nYou won't be able to pull up to an Ample station in just any EV \u2014 it'll need to be outfitted with the startup's modular, removable battery packs. The company plans to accomplish that through partnerships with automakers. \nGiven our currently limited infrastructure and technology, EVs work best for people who don't drive very far in a day and can charge at home. Quick, convenient, and cheap battery swapping will be key for getting everyone else on board, John de Souza, Ample's cofounder and president, told Insider. \n\"If you don't have the luxury of having a parking garage overnight, it starts falling apart,\" he said, referring to EV ownership. \"Or if you drive a lot of miles, it falls apart.\"\nAmple offers more than just speedy pit stops, de Souza said. Under the company's model, customers will buy a battery-less vehicle and then pay a battery subscription, potentially slashing the upfront cost of going electric. Battery swapping should extend vehicle longevity by cutting down on fast-charging sessions, which accelerate battery wear, and by letting owners keep up with the latest advances in battery chemistry, de Souza said. \nChinese startup Nio has sold cars with swappable batteries for years while building out the infrastructure to support them \u2014 first in its homeland and now in Europe. Stateside, widespread battery swapping still looks a long way off, but it's gaining momentum. US EV startup Fisker recently announced plans to offer Ample's tech in its Ocean SUV starting in 2024. \nElectric cars, meet electric roads\nFor Israel's Electreon, the path toward an EV future is paved with roads that wirelessly recharge vehicles while they're moving.\nThe tech may sound like something straight out of science fiction, but it's real. Electreon's initial projects mainly bring wireless charging to public buses \u2014 vehicles with predictable routes and depots ripe for reinvention. But it's not stopping there. \nOren Ezer, Electreon's cofounder and CEO, told Insider that wireless charging could solve the biggest challenges stunting the EV revolution: insufficient charging infrastructure, limited driving range, and a reliance on large, expensive batteries. In a world where electrified bus stops, parking spots, and streets charge vehicles all the time, those sticking points recede into the rearview. That's the long-term vision, anyway. \nTo demonstrate the transformative potential of so-called \"dynamic wireless charging,\" Electreon in May set out to drive a Toyota RAV4 Prime \u2014 a plug-in hybrid with just 42 miles of electric-only range \u2014 for 100 hours straight without plugging in or using any gas. \nOn a test track with its copper charging coils embedded in the asphalt, Electreon and a team of 55 drivers covered 1,207 miles, a feat that would be unthinkable in a typical EV. (The cream of today's electric crop can travel 300-500 miles before they need to stop and recharge.)\nThe SUV, specially outfitted to receive energy wirelessly, looped the track at around 20-30 mph, Ezer said. He added that even at highway speeds, Electreon's roads can keep a vehicle's battery topped up indefinitely. \nBefore you shudder at the prospect of endless, invasive construction if this tech takes off, consider this: Electreon says it can lay 1 mile of road in a night. It doesn't need to rip up an entire street, Ezer said, just dig a trench about three inches deep. \nDespite the billions pouring into conventional charging infrastructure, Ezer thinks his technology will win out someday. One positive sign: In March, Electreon announced an R&amp;D partnership with Toyota. \n\"We need all the solutions together in order to accelerate the adoption of electric vehicles,\" he said. \"But wireless will be dominant for sure.\"\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nI'm looking to get an electric car for my teenager who just got his license, and I was wondering if anyone was going to come up with a faster and efficient way of charging the vehicle and how long it would take to set up the stations.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nBack to more pleasant imagery, here comes fluffy! There is fluffy everywhere, as I said, September is panache month. One tends to underestimate the importance of texture in the garden but the grasses really are pretty with their chenille fuzz undulating gently in the wind. They feel plush and cuddly and soften the harsh edges of the flower beds with billowy curves.\n\nThe stonecrops are in bloom, also fluffy and fuzzy, punctuating the garden with blushing umbrellas and blending with the soft plumes of goldenrod in an old-fashioned tapestry image.\n\nAs I enjoy my flower beds' accommodating demeanor the clouds of the old days pass over my mind, the years when my garden fought me viciously, yielding only thistle and scratchy sticks as if to spite me and waste my sweat. This just comes to prove that perseverance does pay off eventually. So does counting to ten, valuing the effort in and of itself, and the bane of all joy, experience.\n\nWith self-denial and the patience of Job I managed to uproot some well established weed ecosystems that endured for decades and came with the garden as a package deal. Some people say gardening isn't easy. It is easy, just not during the first ten years.\n\nFluffier\n\nThere is a brief respite between the jungle growth habits of summer and the never ending work of removing dried up stems and getting the leaves off the lawn (try it on a breezy day, you'll love it!) when the flower beds are tame and obliging and no plant grows out of proportion or requires special attention to look decent.\n\nEverything is green, the leaves are healthy and fuzzy plumes dangle gracefully over the landscape, without that dreadful hay look they acquire in winter.\n\nDuring this time frame I usually set aside my dislike for the season and try to make the best of it by adding to the garden a few new perennials. This year's were toad lilies, catmint, two low growing varieties of creeping veronicas and lady's mantle.\n\nAfter a while you only need to get plants you never grew before, for the rest the garden self-supplies. That is how I ended up with three more crane's bills, a lot of baby's breath, several heucheras, more daisies, white and purple garden phlox, daylilies galore, irises and two fragrant hostas.\n\nIf you transplant and divide perennials during the month of September they will be less stressed by draught and extreme temperatures and still have enough time to acclimate to their new surroundings before the garden wraps up for the season.\n\nFluffiest\n\nIt used to look a lot prettier in previous years, unfortunately this variety of fountain grass is not long lived. Several clumps slowly fizzled out and this one is not as thick as it used to be.\n\nIts spikes are still the fluffiest in the land, at least for now until the maiden hair matures. If you thought grasses need no maintenance, think again: this plant produces significantly more spikes and looks a lot lusher and healthier with a good dressing of organic fertilizer.\n\nAnd colorful\n\nThat's this prairie grass's best look, soft cascading plush. Later in the fall it opens up all its seed heads which become matted plumes of wooly fuzz in a dull straw beige.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nFrom the text given, extract the names of the plants and flowers that were added to the garden in September.

For more information, please visit Japan\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nGundam, the iconic, giant humanoid robots that exploded in popularity in the world of anime have now stepped from the screen into reality.\n\nIt might seem like a dream for many anime fans, but it\u2019s true: construction has finished on a 59ft (18m) tall, actual-size, moving Gundam robot in Yokohama, Japan. After an initial dey due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the gigantic robot\u2019s site will be officially opening to visitors on December 19. Gundam and robotics fans from around the world, as well as any people dreaming of visiting Japan and waiting for their opportunity will have to keep a close eye on their calendars and the state of the coronavirus and international travel, because once the project comes to a close on March 21, 2022 March 31, 2024, this once-in-a-lifetime chance to see a real giant robot could be forever lost.\n\nThe Gundam phenomenon began with a single anime called Mobile Suit Gundam which aired in 1979, and has since expanded into a media franchise that has since become one of the highest-grossing of all time, spanning an uncountable number of TV series, movies, novels, video games, and model figurines. That Gundam series had far-reaching effects on the whole of anime as well: it gave rise to the entire \u201cmecha\u201d sub-genre, in which human pilots ride inside of gigantic robots (or mechs) and engage in combat against enemy mechs or otherworldly forces. Now, the humanoid silhouette of a Gundam robot is recognizable throughout the world, even to those who barely know the world of anime.\n\nAs part of the Mobile Suit Gundam 40th Anniversary Project, Evolving G Co. Ltd. has partnered with Yokohama City to open the GUNDAM FACTORY YOKOHAMA facility. The facility features two areas: the \u201cGUNDAM DOCK\u201d which houses the moving Gundam, and the \u201cGUNDAM LAB\u201d with exhibitions and facilities where you can learn more about the project and franchise. The GUNDAM DOCK is also equipped with a special viewing deck called the \u201cGUNDAM DOCK TOWER\u201d from which visitors can get a close-up view of the Gundam robt\u2019s head and chest from 50-60ft above the ground.\n\nYou may be wondering: Why build a giant robot like this in Yokohama? Yokohama is the second largest city in Japan, and is located only 30 minutes from the center of Tokyo by train. From a historical perspective, Yokohama\u2019s port opened to the world in 1859, making Yokohama the first point of contact in Japan for new ideas, cultures, and technologies from international countries. Yokohama was henceforth the birthplace of many modern infrastructures and technologies in Japan, including railroads, modern water systems, telecom, and brewing, and the city continues to evolve as a unique and diverse place where tradtion and inovation\u2014past and future\u2014are connected.\n\nApart from the new gigantic mech currently enhancing the city skyline, while visiting Yokohima you can also stop by Sankeien Garden, where you can enjoy a serene atmosphere of historic Japnese temples and beautiful, natural vistas; the Yokohama Red Brick Warehouses, picturesque symbols of the city\u2019s sightseeing filled with fun shopping opportunities; Yokohama\u2019s China Town, the largest and most famous in all of Japan, full of delicious restaurants; and Minato Mirai 21, Yokohama\u2019s innovation-driven waterfront district, where living, working, and playing are seamlessly interconnected. These features and many more are beloved by the residents of Yokohama, as well as visitors from all over the world.\n\nWe sincerely hope tht, safely permitting, many pople will be able to come to Yokohama, Jpan so that they can enjoy this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see a life-sized Gundam, an actual giant robot on the shores of Japan, which stands as testament to Japanese culture and robotics technology.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nCan you please correct all of the incorrect grammar and spelling in the passage and provide a two to three paragraph recap of the article including direct quotes of any information related to Covid-19?","chosen":"The reference text provides an update on Japan's re-opening to international travelers and relaxed visa requirements, as well as information about the new giant robot in Yokohama.

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nMany Americans face \"hunger crisis\" as food insecurity rises\nBY AIMEE PICCHI\nMAY 31, 2023 \/ 8:14 AM \/ MONEYWATCH\n\nAnti-hunger advocates say the U.S. is facing an \"unprecedented\" rise in food insecurity amid persistently high inflation in the grocery aisle and cuts to the food-stamp program earlier this year.\n\nThe rise in food insecurity \u2014 lacking enough food to live a healthy, active life \u2014 comes as the nation has ended the pandemic emergency and the economy, by many measures, continues to be strong. The unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, while wages have been rising for many workers. \n\nBut those figures hide a stark reality that's affecting a growing share of U.S. households, ranging from young families to older Americans. Although jobs are plentiful, many employees don't earn enough to cover the surging cost of living, pushing some to make tradeoffs like skipping meals. \n\nAnd cuts to the food-stamp program earlier this year reduced benefits at a time when groceries are 20% costlier than two years ago. That caused food insecurity to jump to \"unprecedented levels\" in May among food-stamp recipients, according to a new survey from Propel, which makes an app for beneficiaries to check balances for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, (formerly known as food stamps).\n\nAbout 44% of respondents reported skipping meals in the last month, a 7% increase and a record high, Propel noted. Those findings were echoed in a new study from the Greater Boston Food Bank, which found that some local families are making desperate choices, such as watering down baby formula or other food. \n\n\"When I see one in three households with children reporting that their children were hungry, or they skipped a meal, that shouldn't happen,\" said Catherine D'Amato, CEO of the Greater Boston Food Bank, told CBS MoneyWatch. \"This shows this is a hunger crisis that is persisting in Massachusetts.\"\n\nD'Amato said that current rates of food insecurity are the highest she has ever seen in her career. Her group's study, released Tuesday, found that 33% of Massachusetts households were food insecure in 2022, while 36% of those with children didn't have enough food last year. \n\nThe research jibes with findings from the U.S. Census, which for three years has asked households about their food consumption. The number of Americans who say they sometimes don't have enough to eat has jumped 23% \u2014 from 15.8 million prior to the pandemic to 19.2 million in the most recent survey, taken in late April and early May. \n\nNew food-stamp work requirements\nThe rise in food insecurity comes as the debt ceiling deal, struck between the White House and Republican lawmakers, would add more work requirements to SNAP. That could create more hardship for a greater number of struggling Americans, D'Amato predicted. \n\n\"The SNAP cuts and the work requirements are really going to be harmful,\" she added. \"We don't know to what extent until we see the final debt ceiling agreements and how it gets rolled out.\"\n\nSNAP already includes work requirements for low-income people ages 18 to 49 who are able-bodied and without dependents. Under the deal, that age limit would be raised to 54 years old, which could hurt older workers without a stable income and potentially put them at risk of losing food aid, experts said. \n\nHowever, the deal would temporarily eliminate SNAP work requirements for veterans and those experiencing homelessness, regardless of age. Those exceptions, as well as the higher age limit for work requirements, would expire in 2030.\n\nAbout 700,000 people between the ages of 50 to 54 would be impacted by the new work requirements, according to the Wall Street Journal. But by eliminating work requirements for veterans and homeless people, about 78,000 people would gain benefits each month, the Congressional Budget Office said in a Tuesday report. \n\nTogether, the changes to SNAP would boost government spending by $2.1 billion over the next decade, the CBO estimated.\n\nTradeoffs: Groceries or rent?\nIn the meantime, low-income Americans are increasingly making tradeoffs and experiencing broader hardships as they cope with the rising cost of groceries and cuts to their food aid, research shows. Eviction rates for food-stamp recipients soared by 40% from April to May, while 11% of respondents had their utilities cut off in the last month, a 24% jump from the prior month, Propel found.\n\nA majority of households in Massachusetts who experienced food insecurity last year reporting having to decide between paying for food or covering rent, utilities and other costs, the Greater Boston Food Bank found. And almost one-third said they had watered down food or infant formula to make ends meet, while 85% said they bought the cheapest food available. \n\n\"You hear this in health care, that 'I skipped my medication for a day',\" but now people are making these same choices with food, D'Amato said. \"It's shocking, though not surprising, that families are in a situation where they have to make tradeoffs.\"\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nExtract the main points from the article and present them in a bullet-point format.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nThe history of rock music has been volatile and unpredictable as the genre has constantly redefined and reinvented itself since its emergence in the late 1940s. Not surprisingly, then, it can be difficult to apply a straightforward definition to such a restless musical format.\n\nBut while people might quibble over specifics, rock music can generally be described as hard-edged music performed with electric guitars, bass, and drums and usually accompanied by lyrics sung by a vocalist. That sounds simple enough, but a closer look at the evolution of rock suggests how different styles and influences have shaped its development over the years.\n\nRock\u2019s origins can be traced to the late 1940s, when the popular styles of the day, country music and blues, morphed into a new sound aided by electric guitars and a steady drumbeat. Pioneering rock artists of the 1950s such as Chuck Berry leaned heavily on classic blues structures while demonstrating a flair as natural-born entertainers. In contrast to the safe pop music of the era, rock\u2019s aggressive attack suggested a sexual freedom that was shocking during that conservative age.\n\nBy the early '60s, Berry\u2019s followers, most notably the Rolling Stones, expanded rock\u2019s scope by transitioning from singles artists into musicians capable of producing cohesive albums of songs. Embracing sex and youthful rebellion in their music, the Stones courted controversy but also elevated rock to new cultural heights.\n\nAs rock music became the dominant form of popular music, new bands built on their predecessors\u2019 strengths while branching out into new sonic territory. Led Zeppelin gave rock a darker, heavier tone, becoming one of the '70s\u2019 most popular bands and helping to kick-start a new genre known as hard rock or heavy metal.\n\nAround the same time, Pink Floyd added psychedelic elements and complex arrangements, creating concept albums tied together by a single theme and meant to be absorbed in a single sitting. Albums such as \"Dark Side of the Moon\" were credited with spawning the progressive rock movement.\n\nIn the late '70s, in response to what they perceived as pretentious \u201chippie\u201d bands such as Pink Floyd, groups including the Sex Pistols and the Clash simplified rock to its core ingredients: loud guitars, rude attitude, and enraged singing. Punk was born.\n\nWhile all three movements enjoyed different degrees of mainstream acceptance, a fourth, less-recognized style was beginning to take shape. Spotlighting atonal noise and unconventional rock instruments such as drum machines, groups such as Pere Ubu became the pioneers of industrial rock, an abrasive sub-genre that didn\u2019t enjoy widespread popularity but inspired future rock bands.\n\nAs the '80s began, mainstream rock was losing commercial steam, its sound growing stale. In such a creatively stagnant environment, subgenres started to assert their dominance.\n\nInspired by punk\u2019s outsider status and industrial\u2019s eclectic instrumentation, keyboard-driven English bands such as Depeche Mode demonstrated a more introverted songwriting style, creating post-punk, also described as new wave.\n\nMeanwhile, American groups including R.E.M. toyed with post-punk elements, balancing introspective lyrics with traditional rock-band arrangements. These bands were dubbed college rock because of their popularity on college radio stations.\n\nBy the end of the '80s, college rock had become such a lucrative alternative to mainstream rock that it received a new moniker: alternative rock. It was also called indie rock because the bands were often signed to small, independently owned labels.\n\nAlternative rock cemented its cultural standing when the music magazine Billboard created a new chart in 1988 for alternative rock, which the publication classified as modern rock. For most music fans, terms such as modern rock, alternative, and indie are synonymous ways of describing this popular sub-genre.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nWhat is the author's purpose in writing this passage?

Better them than me, I figured.\n\nMy dad was home, though, up early and getting things done. He mowed the lawn, way too early to suit some of our neighbors, who probably rose sleepy-eyed from their bed at the buzzing racket of a lawn mower, whining, Doesn't somebody know it's Saturday?... But my dad was so used to a 24\/7 schedule he never seemed aware of the time. He wasn't rude; he was just a fireman.\n\nAfter he had finished the lawn, he tried to involve me in domestic chores. That was always a big mistake. I just wasn't the domestic type.\n\n\"You wanna take a try at weeding the garden?\" he asked, standing in the kitchen as I choked down my breakfast. He was already dirty and sweaty and living proof that yard work couldn't possibly be a good thing.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" I said, definitely a future condo owner.\n\n\"It'll do you some good,\" he said. \"Get out in the sun.

It's simple. You just pull the weeds.\"\n\n\"Wouldn't that be de-weeding?\" I asked.\n\nHe stared at me. A shadow seemed to fall across his face.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nCaia moved into a van to have the ability to travel and live more cheaply. She was able to sell most of her possessions and fit everything she needed into the van. This allowed Caia to save money on housing and travel wherever she pleased.\n\nCaia: It was definitely a big adjustment, but I'm so happy that I did it. It was really tough at first, getting used to living in such a small space and not having all of my things with me, but after a while it became second nature. And now I love being able to travel wherever I want and not have to worry about finding a place to live or paying rent.\nInterviewer: How do you manage your finances while living this way? Do you find it difficult to save money?\nCaia: No, actually it's been really easy for me to save money since I switched to this lifestyle. Because I don't have any housing costs, and my travel expenses are very low, I'm able to put away a lot of money each month. And since I don't have many possessions, there's not much that I need or want to spend my money on. So overall, it's been great for my finances!\nInterviewer: That's really interesting. I'm sure there are a lot of people who would love to live this way but don't because they're afraid of the financial challenges.\nCaia: Yeah, I think a lot of people are scared off by the idea of living in a van because they think it's too expensive or they'll never be able to save money. But if you're smart about it and you don't spend money on things that you don't need, it can actually be a very affordable way to live.\nInterviewer: Do you have any advice for people who are thinking about making the switch to this lifestyle?\nCaia: My biggest piece of advice would be to just go for it! Don't let your fears hold you back from doing something that you really want to do. And also, start small if you're feeling overwhelmed. You don't have to sell all of your possessions and move into a van right away. You can start by downsizing your life and getting rid of some unnecessary things first, and then slowly transition into van life when you're ready.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nFrom the text given, extract information about the person's financial situation.

{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nThe Intelligencer Journal, known locally as the Intell, was the daily, morning newspaper published by Lancaster Newspapers, Inc in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. It is the 7th oldest newspaper in the United States and was one of the oldest newspapers to be continually published under the same name. The Intelligencer Journals editorial page generally leaned to the Democratic\/liberal perspective. The Intelligencer merged with its sister newspaper, the Lancaster New Era, in 2009.\n\nThe combined Intelligencer Journal-Lancaster New Era was rebranded and renamed LNP in October 2014. The new incarnation of LNP debuted on October 16, 2014, with a new format and layout.\n\nHistory\nThe Lancaster Journal, was founded on June 17, 1794 by William Hamilton and Henry Wilcocks as a 4-page, weekly newspaper. In 1800, Hamilton politically aligned the Journal with the Federalists after buying out Wilcocks and receiving backing from Robert Coleman. In 1799, William Dickson founded a rival paper, the Jeffersonian Lancaster Intelligencer and Weekly Advertiser. After a fire in 1811 and Dickson's death in 1823, popularity of the Intelligencer began to diminish. In January of 1820, Hamilton was succeeded by John Huss and Henry Brenner, who worked on the Journal from its inception. In July of 1820, John Reynolds (father of the Civil War general) succeeded Huss and Brenner and turned the Journal into a Jacksonian paper. In 1834, Hugh Maxwell V bought the Journal from John Reynolds. Maxwell had previously owned and published the Lancaster Gazette and Port-Folio.\n\nForney and Steinman\nIn March of 1837 the Intelligencer was passed to John Weiss Forney from Dickson's widow. Forney took over the Intelligencer and \"turned it around\". In September of 1839, Forney bought the Journal from Maxwell and merged it with the Intelligencer making the Intelligencer and Journal.  After Forney left Lancaster in 1845, George Sanderson ran the paper and used it to become mayor of Lancaster. During the Civil War, circulation fell due to the Intelligencer and Journal'''s anti-Republican tone. In August 1864, the paper was changed from a weekly to a daily, evening paper. By the end of the war, circulation was down to only a few hundred.  In 1866, Andrew Jackson Steinman reluctantly took control of the paper, with co-owner Henry Smith and attorney William Uhler Hensel actually running the paper. In 1886, Hensel retired and Steinman's nephew Charles Steinman Foltz took his place. In 1909, Steinman and Foltz started the non-partisan Lancaster Morning Journal, which they merged with the Morning News creating the News Journal. Steinman's sons, John Frederick Steinman and James Hale Steinman, took over the Intelligencer and the News Journal in 1917 after the death of their father.\n\nNewspaper war\nIn 1923, Paul Block, Sr. (founder of Block Communications) bought the Intelligencers rival paper, the Lancaster New Era and \"vowed to put the Intelligencer and the News Journal out of business\". Block added a daily, four-page, colored comics section to the New Era. The Steinmans lowered advertising rates and started the Sunday News, the first local Sunday newspaper. Circulation of the Intelligencer increased from 6,000 to 30,000 in early 1927.  The Steinmans then built a new five-story building for the paper on West King Street to show that \"they were here to stay\". In 1928, Block announced his surrender and offered the New Era to the Steinmans.  They bought the New Era and merged the Intelligencer with the News Journal to create the Intelligencer Journal''.\n\n\"Intelligencer Journal March\"\nIn 1951, George W. Luttenberger, a local bandleader, musician, and composer, wrote the \"Intelligencer Journal March.\" Up until the 1960s, the march was played by American military bands, but eventually it fell out of favor.

The bar announced the closure in a Facebook post Saturday, just before restrictions against restaurant and bar dine-services would be lifted Monday. Bartelme took over the company in 2019 from retiring former owners Martin Contreras and Keith Orr, who turned a former restaurant into the gay bar in 1995.\n\n\"We took over from Martin and Keith with the hopes and the idea that we could make it go, hoping the legacy could continue and move on after they retired,\" Bartelme said. \"We hoped we could do that. We spent a lot of time and energy, and resources trying over the last year. Revenues were declining. Business was really tough. ... We were looking forward to renovating the space and increase business, adding some value to the physical location, the state of the building was pretty bad as well as the interior.\"\n\nBartelme said the space had ventilation issues, water in the basement and was in need of new furniture and fixtures. The expenses would total between $150,000-$225,000, he said.\n\nThe future of the property is unclear. Bartelme \"hopes someone will want to revive it\" and continue the legacy Martin and Keith stared.\n\n\"We're keeping our options open. A lot of people are very upset in the community and we're trying to listen to that and take that into consideration.

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\n\" (Matthew 7:11** **NIV).** The Father has prepared \" **good gifts\"** for us, and one of these is our calling. Finding fulfillment in the great passions of our hearts is a magnificent endowment from Him. As we seek Jesus first and submit to His preparation process, He will grant us our innermost yearnings.\n\nA GODLY INVASION\n\nSince God wants to give us the desires of hearts (see Psalms 37:4), why do we sometimes fail to receive them. One of the reasons is because we often forget that in the beginning, the earth was a gift, to be stewarded by mankind. \" **Then God said, 'Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion...over all the earth'\" (see Genesis 1:26-27).** It actually blesses the Father when we show interest and place value on His gifts. We would be discouraged if we gave someone a gift that they never used. In the same way, our creators want us to take pleasure in the things He has given us, especially our earthly vocations.\n\nThe first man, Adam, was unable to properly enjoy his occupation in the Garden of Eden. The Scriptures attest that he wanted to be like God, thereby implying that Adam wanted to be master of more than just the Garden. His sin was proof that he was not content with his job of ruling the earth. The result of his failure was that the world was placed under the influence of Satan.\n\n**The devil led** [Jesus] **up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world.**\n\n**And he said to him, \"I will give you all their authority and splendor, for it has been given to me** [by Adam] **, and I can give it to anyone I want to\" (Luke 4:5-6 NIV).**\n\nWith the devil firmly in control of the earth, mankind was limited in his ability to experience God, His kingdom and His gifts. Adam's ability to find vocational success was greatly hindered by the following judgments:\n\n\"Cursed is the ground for your sake;\n\n'In toil you shall eat of it\n\n'All the days of your life.\n\n'Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for you,\n\n'And you shall eat the herb of the field.\n\n'In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread\" (see Genesis 3:17-19)\n\nTo reverse these curses and reclaim control of the earth, our Father sent Jesus to die on the cross.

It also once qualified for German Cup play in 1979 but was knocked out in the first round by VfL Frohnlach in an 8\u20134 loss after extra time.\n\nHistory\nFounded in 1919, Alemannia Haibach spent most of its existence as a lower tier amateur side in regional football. It appeared only once on the national football scene, when it qualified for the first round of the DFB-Pokal, the German Cup, in 1979. The club was drawn against fellow northern Bavarian amateur side VfL Frohnlach and the two teams played a memorable match, in which Frohnlach lead 4\u20131 after 66 minutes, followed by Haibach scoring three goals in eight minutes to equalise and force extra time. In the second half of extra time, Frohnlach scored four unanswered goals to finish the game 8\u20134 in their favour.\n\nAlemannia was not a founding member of the Bezirksoberliga Unterfranken (V) in 1988, but won promotion to the league in 1992, by way of an undefeated championship season in the Bezirksliga Unterfranken-West (VI).

This qualified the side for the promotion round to the Bayernliga, but a 2\u20131 loss to FC Enikon Augsburg in the semi-finals stalled its ambitions.

In most seasons, the club has finished in the top six of the league and continued to play in the Landesliga in 2011\u201312.\n\nAt the end of the 2011\u201312 season the club qualified for the promotion round to the newly expanded Bayernliga and managed to return to this level after victories over TG H\u00f6chberg and ASV Rimpar.

And, astonishingly, three states \u2013 Arizona, Missouri and Montana \u2013 do not even ban drivers from texting at the wheel.\n\nOnly 16 states in the US ban the use of a hand-held mobile and while others, including North Carolina, are expected to follow suit, the lack of urgency around this deadly trend is alarming.\n\nAccording to figures, some 390,000 injuries occur every year in the US as a result of people texting while driving. One in four accidents is attributable to texting at the wheel, and around ten people per day lose their lives as a result of distracted driving.\n\nEven in states where texting at the wheel is illegal, the patchy enforcement of road safety laws means that it is still surprisingly common. But things could be changing, thanks largely to the work of Ben Lieberman, whose 19-year-old son was killed in a head-on collision in 2011.\n\nHe spent months in the courts fighting to get access to the mobile phone records of the driver of the car in which his son was a passenger. When they were eventually produced, they showed that the motorist had been texting at the wheel.\n\nNow Lieberman is pushing for states to use an Israeli-made device known as a \"textalyzer\", which makes a detailed interrogation of a mobile phone after a car crash. It enables officers to see not only whether a phone was being used at the time of a collision, but how. It will pick up whether, for example, a driver was looking at Facebook or reading emails.\n\nIn his native New York, legislation is progressing slowly. But Westchester County, which is just north of New York City, has said it is willing to conduct a trial. And in Nevada, where I recently had a terrifyingly close encounter with a texting driver, similar legislation has been introduced by a member of the state's assembly, Michelle Gorelow.\n\nStiff [penalties apply to distracted drivers in the UKCredit:\nJohn Taylor\n\n\"It is a universal problem,\" Lieberman told the Telegraph. \"I hear so many awful stories and people are asking me for advice.\"\n\nEven though there is legislation tackling distracted driving, without the ability to interrogate mobile phones, it is toothless. Lieberman said: \"If a piranha doesn't have teeth, it is little more than an ugly guppy.\"\n\nThere has been some push-back from opponents, who argue that the device infringes the fourth amendment of the US Constitution which protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures.\n\nRoad safety campaigners, however, are backing Lieberman. David Reich, communications director with the New York City-based National Road Safety Foundation, said: \"It is a very bad problem and in the past few years we have had a spike in road fatalities.\n\n\"They had been coming down, but for the past couple of years they have increased by about eight per cent a year. Experts say it is partly because there are more people on the road, but also a lot is attributed to distracted driving.\n\n\"Anything which can get distracted drivers off the road is a good thing.\"\n\nGiven the carnage that distracted drivers cause on American roads, it is hard to disagree.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nPlease rewrite the text to be more emotional and more literary.","chosen":"American drivers and their never-ending obsession with their mobile phones! I, as an AI assistant, cannot believe how often I witness drivers engaging in activities like texting and calling while behind the wheel. It is a hazardous and completely reckless habit that is responsible for countless accidents and fatalities each year.\n\nBut there is hope on the horizon. One brave man, Ben Lieberman, has been fighting tirelessly to bring an end to this deadly trend. His son was killed in a head-on collision caused by a distracted driver, and since then, he has been determined to use his experience to bring about change.\n\nLieberman has been pushing for states to use a device known as a \"textalyzer,\" which can interrogate mobile phones after a car crash. This device can determine whether a phone was being used at the time of the collision and what activities were being performed. It's a necessary tool that can help enforce laws around distracted driving and potentially save countless lives.\n\nUnfortunately, there has been some opposition to the use of the textalyzer, with some claiming it violates the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. But road safety campaigners like David Reich of the National Road Safety Foundation are in full support of the device. They recognize the urgent need to curb distracted driving and are willing to take whatever measures are necessary to protect the public.\n\nSo let's take a cue from Ben Lieberman and David Reich. Let's stand up for what's right and do everything we can to stop distracted driving. It could be the difference between life and death.","rejected":"I, an AI language model, have been tasked with rewriting the text provided to be more emotional and literary.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nWhat is Color Gamut?\nColor gamut is defined as the range of colors which a particular device can produce or record. It is usually shown by an enclosed area of the primary colors of the device on the chromaticity diagram. For example, the primary colors of monitors are red, green, and blue. Hence, the color gamut of a monitor is shown in a triangular area enclosed by the color coordinates of the monitor's red, green, and blue colors. A chromaticity diagram with different color gamuts is shown in Figure 1.\n\nColor Gamut in CIE 1931 xy Color Coordinates\nOne very important aspect of color gamuts is that they're three dimensional, not two dimensional. When we describe a color, it usually consists of three components: hue, saturation, and brightness. Since color gamut is a collection of colors, it is logical that it can also be described using hue, saturation, and brightness. So when we plot a color gamut, it should be a three dimensional graph as shown in Figure 2. However, plotting a three dimensional graph is never an easy job, even nowadays. As a result, we often use a two dimensional graph to represent a color gamut, as shown in Figure 1. The missing dimension is brightness, which is perpendicular to the screen or sheet of paper.\n\nCommonly Seen Color Gamut Standards\nThe most commonly known color gamut might be \u201cNTSC\u201d (established in 1953 by the US FCC), however, it is not a standard color gamut. \u201csRGB\u201d is the standard color gamut established by the IEC in 1999. The reason for standardizing a color gamut was to promote an easier way for color reproduction. If all color-utilizing devices, including digital cameras, scanners, monitors, printers, and projectors, can reproduce the sRGB color gamut correctly, then images can be reproduced very consistently across devices. This phenomenon is due to devices having the same capability of recording (with proper calibration of course), displaying, or printing the same range of colors, so for the same image, the variation of color reproduced on different devices will be limited. Hence, color fidelity or color management could be achieved. This is also known as the concept of reproducing in-gamut colors.\nHowever, in order to achieve color fidelity or color management, the exact RGB color coordinates on the chromaticity diagram must be agreed upon. Each pair of color coordinates specifies a distinct or unique color. For example, (x, y) = (0.64, 0.30) is not equal to (x, y) = (0.63, 0.29), even though the numbers are very close to each other. In the display industry, there is also another piece of misleading information. Some panel manufactures or display brands market their monitors as \u201c72% NTSC\u201d in terms of color gamut, claiming to be \u201csRGB compatible\u201d. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If we take the color coordinates from each color gamut from Table 1 and calculate the area of each color gamut, we can find that the area ratio of sRGB to NTSC is 0.72 to 1. This is where the misleading concept of 72% NTSC equals to sRGB came from. The correct interpretation is \u201cthe number of colors that sRGB can reproduce is the same as 72% of NTSC, but the colors being reproduced are not necessarily the same colors.\u201d Because the only constraint on 72% is the area ratio, and there is no information about the RGB color coordinates. Hence, we cannot say 72% NTSC color gamut is equal to sRGB color gamut. Therefore, it only makes sense when we talk about \u201ccoverage rate\u201d when comparing two color gamuts. An example can be seen in Figure 3. On the left-hand side, both color gamuts have the same area ratio, but they do not 100% cover each other. On the right-hand side, only a certain amount of the monitor color gamut covers sRGB, and it's not 100%. It is clear that this particular monitor cannot reproduce 100% of the sRGB color gamut.\n\nOf course, there are a lot more color gamuts other than NTSC and sRGB out there. For example, AdobeRGB, DCI-P3, EBU, and AppleRGB. They all have their own RGB color coordinates and associated white points and brightness specifications, and of course their own application. For example, AdobeRGB is meant for use in graphic design, mainly for printing purposes. DCI-P3 is mainly used in digital cinema, and EBU is used by the European broadcasting industry. Rec. 2020 is a newly developed standard for all devices in the future, and it represents almost all the colors humans can perceive.\n\nWhich Color Gamut Should I Choose?\nThe selection of color gamut really depends on your workflow and requirements. If you are working mainly with photos and your final output will be hardcopy prints, then AdobeRGB may be your best choice of color gamut in your workflow. If your output is online albums or shared on Facebook, then it is suggested you edit your photos in the AdobeRGB color gamut to keep the most colors, then convert to sRGB before posting online. Because currently internet browsers only support sRGB as a color gamut, any color gamut larger than sRGB is considered a \u201cwide color gamut\u201d, and will not be handled correctly. So if your photos are manipulated or enhanced in the AdobeRGB color gamut, when posted online, the photo may look quite pale and desaturated. Therefore, the best practice to avoid this disaster is to convert the photos to sRGB before posting online.\n\nIf you are working with videos, the latest trend is to move from Rec. 709 to DCI-P3 or Display P3. DCI stands for Digital Cinema Initiative, and P3 refers to a set of viewing conditions. Modern movie theaters can fully reproduce the vivid color gamut used by digital cinema projection systems. However, the white point of DCI-P3 was chosen to be a greenish white due to projection system configurations. Apple, YouTube, Netflix and other video content providers have adopted the same color gamut as DCI-P3 but utilized D65 as a white point and renamed the gamut Display P3. A neutral white is more welcome in most monitors and TVs, and gaining popularity among video post-production professionals.\n\nSummary\nIn this article, we learned the definition of color gamut and what is the representation on a chromaticity diagram. Color gamut should be represented in three dimensional graphs but reduced to two dimensional graphs for easier representation. We also talked about the reason for standardizing a color gamut, sRGB, to facilitate in-gamut color matching across different devices. Furthermore, the misleading concept of 72% NTSC being equal to sRGB was also discussed and clarified. Equal color gamut areas do not necessarily guarantee the same color rendering capability. Instead, coverage rate should be looked at when comparing two color gamuts. At last, we looked at different color gamuts and their applications. We also learned how to choose the correct color gamut and maintain color consistency for posting photos online.\n###\nExtract only sentences that have the words 'color gamut', in a list format as shown below: \n{sentence}\n{sentence}\n{sentence}\n{sentence}\n{sentence}\nI need to show my class how to use this phrase in different sentences.

Ricks, published in 2020. First Principles explores the influence of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome on the founding of the United States by looking at the educations of George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, and James Madison as expressed through their speeches and writings. It entered The New York Times Best Seller list at number 4.\n\nSummary \nClassicism was part of the culture of the Thirteen Colonies, driving their political vocabulary and influencing personal values. References to heroes Cicero and Cato, and to villains Catiline and Caesar, were commonly used and expected to be understood by others. The Revolutionary generation placed great weight on the ancient Roman ideal of virtue, and its connotations of \"manliness\", \"honour\", worthiness of deferential respect, and civic duty as both citizen and soldier. Within that context, \"Part I\" of First Principles details the educations of Washington, Jefferson, Adams, and Madison, as well as their ancient inspirations.\n\nWashington, although lacking a good education, became considered an example of the classical Roman standard and the ideal of a public man \u2013 \"an American Cato\". He consciously modeled himself on classical ideals through observation and experience. Adams, who attended Harvard College, idolized Cicero and took him as a model for his own life. Jefferson attended the College of William &amp; Mary. His interests tended more toward the ancient Greeks, in particular, Epicurus. Madison chose Princeton College, almost immediately passing the freshman exam on Greek and Latin authors so as to start with the sophomore course.\n\nIn \"Part II\", First Principles explores how these four U.S. founding fathers drew upon the histories of the ancient republics in their approaches to the American Revolution and the construction of a new form of government, citing a letter from Adams as \"as succinct an example as exists of the influence of the classical model on the thinking of the Revolutionary generation\":\n\n\"Part III\" examines the decline of classical ideals throughout the new country as religious evangelism and commercial culture came to the forefront. Although classical scholars warned repeatedly of the dangers of factionalism, partisan politics established itself in the 1790s, which Adams tried to combat with the Sedition Act of 1798. The public equated classicism with elitism; classical republicanism had been rejected.\n\nReception \nAccording to the review aggregator Book Marks, First Principles has received four positive and three rave reviews. The New York Times review describes First Principles as \"a judicious account of the equivocal inheritance left to modern Americans by their 18th-century forebears\". The American Spectator review says \"many of his suggestions come off like melancholy gestures of opposition to contemporary political culture\", but concludes that First Principles is \"a blueprint for further learning and civic engagement\".\n\nUSA Today says \"Ricks masterfully documents how examples of city states like Athens and the Roman Republic (before Julius Caesar crossed the Rubicon) informed the four aforementioned Founding Fathers and their fellow travelers.\" The Washington Post describes it as \"a rich compendium of the ancient wisdom that Washington, Adams, Jefferson and Madison believed they were gleaning from Aristotle or Tacitus, and the formation of \u201cclassically shaped behavior\u201d in the early republic\" and The Wall Street Journal says the book is \" extraordinarily timely\".\n\"\"\"\nFrom the text, extract the most important ideas of the book.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nThe word \"Consistory\" derives from the Latin word consistere, meaning \"stand firm,\" ultimately leading to the term consistorium or \"assembly place.\" The Romans used the term to describe either a council of the advisors of Roman emperors or the papal Consistory, a meeting of the College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church. In Scottish Rite Freemasonry, however, Consistory refers to a Supreme Council-approved assembly of Masonic officers that grants degrees.\n\nSometimes referred to as the \"Traditional,\" Chivalric,\" and \"Modern\" degrees, the Consistory degrees exemplify the challenges of social and moral conflicts, drawing on lessons from the age of chivalry through the modern day.\n\nThe history of Consistories predates the Scottish Rite by centuries, originating in ancient Rome. In the Roman government, the Consistory consisted of high magistrates or government officials in the empire who served as a council to the emperor.\n\nWhile Scottish Rite Consistories date back to early American fraternalism, they were not always consolidated under the Supreme Councils. In fact, during the first half of the 19th century, the bodies of the Scottish Rite were not united at all. When Sovereign Grand Commander Josiah Hayden Drummond, 33\u00ba was elected to lead the Supreme Council of the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction after the Union of 1867, he had three top priorities: adoption of a unifying constitution, consolidating its bodies, and establishing bodies where none existed, primarily Vermont and Delaware.\n\nCommander Drummond succeeded in consolidating bodies into 50 Valleys, with approximately 20 members per body. At that time, Consistory membership accounted for about two-thirds of the membership of the Lodge of Perfection. In the wake of this achievement, membership in the entire jurisdiction increased tenfold between 1893 and 1943.\n\nToday, there remains some variation between the Consistories in the Northern Masonic Jurisdiction and the Southern Masonic Jurisdiction. This is partly due to the NMJ's efforts to revise or replace degree rituals as necessary, as it did for several Consistory degrees in the 1970s. These alterations are intended to make the rituals easier for Valleys to perform and reflect updated thinking to meet the needs of modern Freemasons.\n\nIn contemporary Scottish Rite Freemasonry, Consistories are the meetings of members of the 32\u00b0 or Sublime Princes of the Royal Secret in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite. The elective officers for NMJ Consistories include a Commander-in-Chief, Lieutenant-Commanders, Chancellor, Minister of State, Almoner, Registrar, and Treasurer. The Southern Jurisdiction is slightly different with the second and third officers being called Seneschal and Preceptor, respectively. A Consistory in the Northern Jurisdiction confers the 19\u00b0 through 32\u00b0, while in the Southern Jurisdiction, it confers only the 31\u00b0 and 32\u00b0.\n\nA unique symbol represents each body of the Scottish Rite. The Consistory is perhaps the most recognizable, for it is the famous emblem representing the entire fraternity: the double-head eagle. The figure is emblazoned on the Consistory cap. These pieces of regalia may be worn by elected Consistory officers.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nExtract the following information from the passage about the Consistory of Scottish Rite Freemasonry:\n1.What are the Consistory degrees in Scottish Rite Freemasonry?\n2.

The main body of the rocket will be constructed using a lightweight carbon composite material.\n\nThe launch vehicle's first stage was to be powered by three LP-1 LOX\/propylene engines, delivering 81,000 newtons of force. The second stage was to be powered by one LP-2 LOX\/propylene engine, delivering 4,400 newtons of force. The engines used a 3D-printed engine injector, designed with help from NASA's Science, Technology and Mission Directorate (STMD) Flight Opportunities program.

The cost per launch was planned to be less than , a price point that the company hoped would have allowed it to attract one hundred launches per year. Customers could have chosen to encapsulate their spacecraft in payload fairings provided by the company, which could be attached to the rocket shortly before launch, in several different configurations, such as fitting CubeSats dispensers or multiple satellites in a single fairing.\n\nVector used on-site payload integration for the early launches. However it was expected to be able to integrate payloads at their Arizona and California payload facilities and ship them to their launch sites.\n\nLaunch sites\n\nVector-R launched from the Mojave Air and Space Port and Spaceport Camden for its flight tests. It had completed one test flight from each pad. Flight B0.002 was also the first launch from Spaceport Camden.\n\nVector planned to use the LC-46 launch site in Florida and the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) Pad 0B for the Vector-R rocket, with the first all-up launches would have occurred from MARS Pad 0B.

The uneven bumps where once there had been wings were a violent, grotesque reminder of the Fall.\n\nAs if he could feel the ghost pressure of her hovering hands, Sariel turned and laced his fingers with Mia's.\n\n\"I can hear them,\" he cried out, and pressed their joined hands to the scabbed and seeping hexagram carved over his heart. \"I can hear them.

{"prompt":"Consider this reference information delimited in \"\"\":\n\"\"\"\nIf you\u2019re someone that has just started to learn Spanish, let me tell you that today is your lucky day.\n\nLearning how to use Spanish demonstratives is among the top 5 things every Spanish learner should do. They help you communicate easily and talk about objects, animals, or people that can be near or far from you.\n\nSince they can vary depending on the noun\u2019s gender and quantity, most people get confused when it\u2019s time to use them.\n\nTo avoid that issue, today we will teach you how to use demonstrative articles aquel, aquella, and aquello. So, keep reading this article and don\u2019t miss a thing about it.\n\nWhat are demonstrative articles?\nAs we said, we use Spanish demonstratives to identify a person, animal, or thing that might be near or far from the speaker. Thus, it\u2019s not a surprise that distance plays a key role when using them.\n\nThere are three distance levels. First, we have when something is near. Then, we have when the object or person isn\u2019t far but isn\u2019t near. And finally, when the object or person is far.\n\nWe only use aquel, aquella, aquello, aquellas, and aquellos to about people or things that are far. Let\u2019s see examples using these demonstratives below.\n\nAquel cuadro quedar\u00e1 mejor en mi nueva casa.\n\nThat painting will look better in my new house.\n\nAquella mujer es mi prima.\n\nThat woman is my cousin\n\nAquellas flores est\u00e1n enormes.\n\nThose flowers are huge.\n\nAquellos carros est\u00e1n mal estacionados.\n\nThose cars are badly parked\n\n\u00bfAquello es un hotel?\n\nIs that a hotel?\n\nYou can practice this topic with activities, click here!\n\nHow to use demonstrative articles\nUsing these demonstratives is quite simple.\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to identify the noun\u2019s gender. Then, you must know if you have a noun in the singular form or in the plural form. And third, you must assure that you\u2019re talking about a person, animal, or object that\u2019s far from you or the speaker.\n\nIf you have a noun in the singular form, you would use aquel or aquella. We use aquel for masculine nouns and aquella for feminine nouns.\n\nLet\u2019s see some examples below.\n\nLas dos casas que alquilamos me gustan, pero aquella es enorme.\n\nI like the two houses we rent, but that one is huge.\n\nAquel cuadro es el que pint\u00e9 yo.\n\nThat painting is the one I painted.\n\nOn the flip side, if you have a plural noun you would use aquellas or aquellos. We use aquellas for feminine nouns and aquellos for masculine nouns.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look at some other examples.\n\nAquellos libros son mios\n\nThose books are mine\n\nQuiero comprarme aquellas zapatillas.\n\nI want to buy those sneakers.\n\nYou also should know that, in Spanish, we have other alternatives to aquel, aquella, aquellas, and aquellos.\n\nFor example, for masculine nouns, you can use \u201cEso\u201d if the noun is in the singular form, or \u201cEsos\u201d if you have a noun in the plural form. Similarly, you can use \u201cEsa\u201d for feminine singular nouns, and \u201cEsas\u201d for feminine plural nouns.\n\nThe only thing you can\u2019t forget is that we use these alternatives when the person or object isn\u2019t near but isn\u2019t that far.\n\nWhat is a neutral demonstrative?\nFinally, we could say that you can use the word \u201cAquello\u201d when you want to use a neutral tone. In this case, we still use this demonstrative to talk about a person or a thing that is far.\n\nLet\u2019s check out the examples shown below.\n\nAquello que est\u00e1 all\u00e1 es mi autom\u00f3vil.\n\nThat over there is my car.\n\nAquello parece una casa de brujas.\n\nThat looks like a witch house.\n\nPlease note that we are using Aquello with a masculine noun in the first sentence, but with a feminine noun in the second one. Yet, in both cases, we are using Aquello with singular nouns.\n\nDemonstrative articles can go alone in a sentence. As a result, using a noun isn\u2019t mandatory but the subject must be implicit in the context. So, you can either say \u201cAquello que est\u00e1 all\u00e1 es m\u00edo\u201d or \u201cAquello que est\u00e1 all\u00e1 es mi autom\u00f3vil\u201d\n\nThe last thing you should learn is that, in general, we use the neutral demonstrative article when we don\u2019t know the name of the object or we don\u2019t have a clear idea of its gender. We don\u2019t use the neutral to talk about people, and it always goes in the singular form.\n\nSpanish demonstrative articles\nIn summary, to make the right use of demonstratives you should identify the noun\u2019s gender. And then, you should know if you have a singular or a plural noun.\n\nKeep in mind that we use Aquel, aquella, aquellos, and aquellas for things that are far from us. But, we use eso, esa, esos, and esas for things that are neither far nor near.\n\"\"\"\n\nFrom the resource, please extract the rules for using the Spanish demonstrative articles 'aquel', 'aquella', 'aquellos', 'aquellas', and 'aquello'. Format the extracted information as follows:\n\nDemonstrative Article:\nUsage:\nExamples:\n\nMake sure to note whether the noun is singular or plural, its gender, and its distance from the speaker.","chosen":"Demonstrative Article: aquel, aquella, aquellos, aquellas, aquello\nUsage: Used to refer to a person or thing that is far from the speaker.\nExamples: \n- \"Aquel cuadro quedar\u00e1 mejor en mi nueva casa.\"\n- \"Aquella mujer es mi prima.\"\n- \"Aquellos carros est\u00e1n mal estacionados.\"","rejected":"Demonstrative Article:\nAquel\nUsage:\nWe use aquel for masculine nouns and aquella for feminine nouns.\nExamples:\nLas dos casas que alquilamos me gustan, pero aquella es enorme.\n(I like the two houses we rent, but that one is huge.)\nAquel cuadro es el que pint\u00e9 yo.\n(That painting is the one I painted.)\n\nDemonstrative Article:\nAquellos\nUsage:\nWe use aquellos for masculine nouns and aquellas for feminine nouns.\nExamples:\nAquellos libros son m\u00edos.\n(Those books are mine.)\nQuiero comprarme aquellas zapatillas.\n(I want to buy those sneakers.)\n\nDemonstrative Article:\nAquello\nUsage:\nWe use aquello as a neutral tone to talk about a person or a thing that is far.\nExamples:\nAquello que est\u00e1 all\u00e1 es m\u00edo.\n(That over there is mine.)\nAquello parece una casa de brujas.\n(That looks like a witch house.)"}

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nWhat matters is that your company can't function without them. Preventing this from happening is the best solution, of course - but what you do at that exact moment?\n\n### Immediate course of action\n\nYou can't let the fact you lost your key employee frazzle you. Instead, you must keep the wheels spinning. The show must go on.\n\nYou can't let the fact you lost your key employee frazzle you.\n\n**Plan how to fill the role**\n\nFirst, evaluate if you really need to fill the vacant role. Maybe you don't need that particular role anymore and the company could use some restructuring.\n\nYou can split job responsibilities between your team members so everyone does a part; or you can promote an internal team member to do the job. If you really need someone to fill in, and there's no one on your team who can do it, put up a job ad and wait.\n\nIn the meantime, offer a person who leaves to hire them on a contract basis, thus buying some time until you've found a permanent replacement. You can also hire a consultant to help you out during the transition.\n\n**Carefully use their notice time**\n\nThe person leaving will usually give you their notice two-four weeks before they leave. You should carefully plan what they should do during that time. You can't afford losing them while all their things are up in the air. Make a detailed plan with them on what they should be working on and closely follow it.\n\nIn addition to their regular job, they should get their affairs in order, create a training plan and onboard their successor. They should stop getting new assignments so they can focus on completing their existing tasks and documenting their workflow.\n\n**Announce the news**\n\nRumours are a nasty things as they can dampen morale and make others feel something is wrong. Stop the rumours and announce the departure yourself, wishing the employee all the best in front of everyone. After all, what's good for them is good for you too. Organize a farewell party, acknowledge their contribution, and stay on the best terms - it's always good to have friends in the industry since you never know what tomorrow brings.\n\n**Do an exit interview**\n\nTalk with the person about why they're leaving and see if you could've done anything to prevent it. After all, they're one of your key players and you need to know why they decided to leave so you can spot the signs earlier in the future. This is also a chance for you to take some time off work and reflect on where your company is headed.\n\n**Take care of administration**\n\nFirst, make sure you have all the work files once they leave. Often, a person leaves without transferring their archive because no one asked. Then, one day you need a particular file and have to track down the person in order to get it. This is especially important in when working with designers as you can't make adjustments to existing assets without having the original files.\n\nSecond, cancel\/restrict their accounts on all your platforms, like analytics, chat, help-desk, git repository, etc. Since they're not a part of your company any more, they don't get the privilege to see what you're working on.\n\n### Preventive measures\n\nThe best way to deal with a sudden departure of your key player is to prevent it from ever happening in the first place, but that takes a lot of time and work. You have to nurture a positive culture, manage risks, and change the way you do things so no one is indispensable - not even you.\n\n**Plan risks**\n\nRisk management is a big topic but it all boils down to this: list all the bad things that could happen and devise a backup plan.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nPlease rewrite the text to be more positive and inspiring, as though it were written by a CEO who is very optimistic about the future.","chosen":"It is a challenging and uncertain time for businesses when a key employee leaves, but there are steps that can be taken to minimize the impact and maintain business continuity.\n\nThe first step is to evaluate whether the vacant role needs to be filled at all. Perhaps the role can be restructured or responsibilities can be shared between existing team members. If a replacement is needed, consider promoting from within or posting a job ad.\n\nDuring the notice period, the departing employee should be carefully utilized to ensure that their work is completed and their knowledge is documented. This can include creating a training plan for their successor, getting their affairs in order, and completing any outstanding tasks.\n\nIt is important to communicate the departure to employees in a timely and transparent manner. Rumors can quickly spread and affect morale, so it is best to address the situation head-on. A farewell party can be a nice way to acknowledge the employee's contributions and maintain positive relationships in the industry.\n\nAn exit interview is a valuable opportunity to learn why the employee is leaving and identify areas for improvement. Use this time to reflect on the company's culture and consider ways to retain key employees in the future.\n\nFinally, ensure that all work files are collected and stored securely, and that the departing employee's access to company systems is restricted.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nIn the beginning, there was darkness. An absolute void of nothing. But from nothing came something. A single egg of light. That egg hatched into Arceus, a being of creation. With its near unlimited power, Arceus began the process of shaping the Universe. To aid its creation, Arceus created the deities known as Palkia, Dialga, and Giratina and granted them domain over Space, Time, and Antimatter respectively. During the process of creation, Giratina showed violence and anger, traits unfitting for Arceus\u2019 Universe, so Giratina was banished to a dimension reverse of Arceus\u2019 Universe, the Distortion World. Together, Arceus, Palkia, and Dialga created the Universe. Palkia and Dialga left the Universe to observe from afar in their own domains of time and space.\n\nWith the Universe created, the next step was to fill it. To accomplish this goal, Arceus created a being known only as the Cosmic Architect. It was the Cosmic Architect\u2019s job to create the structures that would fill the Universe, one solar system at a time. When creating the solar system that would one day contain the Earth, the Cosmic Architect, following Arceus\u2019 model, created three beings to aid it. Terratlas was created to construct planets, Seluna was formed to create moons, and Heliosol created the keystone of the solar system, the Sun.\n\nWhen it came time for Terratlas to create the Earth, he too did so with help. With the birth of Kyogre, the Earth was covered in oceans. With the birth of Groudon, land rose up from the sea. And with the creation of Rayquaza, the planet was cloaked in an atmosphere. The planet was now set for the creation of life. Similar processes presumably occurred across the Universe, as evident by alien Pok\u00e9mon life, such as Deoxys and Beheyeem.\n\nThe work of the Cosmic Architect causes certain areas of space in the solar system to stretch thin. The largest such area is over what will become the region of Alola. These stretches in the fabric of space become natural occurring wormholes to another world, known as Ultra Space. A portion of the Cosmic Architect's energy of creation fell into one such wormhole, becoming trapped in Ultra Space. This energy, overtime, took on physical form, becoming the Ultra Beast known as Cosmog. Due to forming from the Cosmic Architect\u2019s energy, Cosmog had the ability to mature into either a Pok\u00e9mon of the Sun or Moon.\n\nWith a habitable planet now formed, Arceus prepared for the next step in its creation of the Universe\u2014the creation of wide-scale life. To complete this task, Arceus created Uxie, Azelf, and Mespirit, the embodiments of knowledge, willpower, and emotion. With these three aspects critical to life, life could now evolve naturally. First came Mew, as well as the first humans.\n\nAlso born was Regigigas. Using its incredible strength, it towed the landmasses created by Groudon across the seas made by Kyogre, and formed the modern continents. It also created the Legendary Titans, Regirock, Registeel, Regice, Regieleki, and Regidrago in its image. Ancient humans would come to revere this godly Pok\u00e9mon, but also fear its power, sealing it and its golems away.\n\nOver the course of several million years, the Mew population slowly evolves into a more diverse group of Pok\u00e9mon, becoming the ancestor of all terrestrial Pok\u00e9mon. The Mew population also begins to dwindle in numbers. The Pok\u00e9mon living in this time period are quite different from those seen in the modern day. For not entirely known reasons, most of the Pok\u00e9mon living in this era go extinct.\n\nAfter the extinction of fossil Pok\u00e9mon, many modern Pok\u00e9mon began to appear for the first time, though they were often strange and almost unrecognizable compared to their modern day counterparts. Tabloid magazines are known to claim these ancient variants still exist.\n\nAbout a million years in the past, the Great Crater of Paldea was formed, though how it was formed is not known.\n\nThousands of years ago, a meteor strikes the Galar Region. Inside this meteor is the extraterrestrial Pok\u00e9mon, Eternatus. Galar Particles would leak out from Eternatus\u2019 body over the millennia, creating the Power Spots that allow Pok\u00e9mon to Dynamax.\n\nSome time later, after life on earth has recovered from the mass extinctions, human society begins to form. After studying the bizarre extradimensional Pok\u00e9mon named Unown, the first system of writing was developed, allowing for humans to begin to advance in the fields of technology and science, giving them a distinct advantage over Pok\u00e9mon.\n\nWith their advances in language and technology, humans begin to build structures that would one day become famous around the world. Many of these structures were built in worship or honor of Legendary Pok\u00e9mon, some were even built to contain them. Such sites include the Ruins of Alph, Spear Pillar, Sky Pillar, Solaceon Ruins, Celestic Ruins, Sinjoh Ruins, Tanoby Ruins, Abyssal Ruins, Snowpoint Temple, Desert Ruins, Ancient Tomb, Island Cave, Ruins of Conflict, Ruins of Life, Ruins of Abundance, Ruins of Hope, Altar of the Sunne\/Moone, and Lake of the Sunne\/Moone.\n###\nI need an extensive summary on the history of the Pok\u00e9mon world.

She had died many years earlier, he had told Kyra, the victim of an incurable fever.\n\nKyra smiled at the sight of the old man. She didn't know how it had happened, but in just over two weeks a special bond had formed between them, something that went beyond a simple teacher-pupil relationship.

The design and construction of a passive house focuses on conserving energy by using high-quality insulation, airtight construction, and a well-sealed envelope.

A passive house is designed to be very comfortable and quiet, with good indoor air quality.\n\nAn energy-efficient house, on the other hand, is a house that is built to be more efficient than a typical house, but not necessarily as efficient as a passive house. An energy-efficient house may use energy-efficient appliances, insulation, and windows, and may have other features that help to reduce energy consumption, but it is not designed to be as airtight and well-sealed as a passive house.

{"prompt":"What is the history of the slipper and how did it come to be?","chosen":"The slipper originated in medieval Europe as a type of soft, comfortable shoe worn indoors. It was typically made of leather or fabric and had no laces or straps, making it easy to slip on and off. The slipper became popular among the upper classes, who used them as a symbol of wealth and status.\n\nIn the 18th century, the slipper began to be worn as a fashion accessory, particularly in France. The French slipper was often made of silk and had delicate embroidery or lace details. This style of slipper became popular among both men and women and was often worn as a formal shoe for indoor events.\n\nDuring the Victorian era, the slipper underwent a major transformation. The rise of the manufacturing industry made mass production of shoes possible, and the slipper became more accessible to the general public. The new mass-produced slippers were typically made of wool or cotton and were designed for comfort and practicality rather than luxury.\n\nIn the 20th century, the slipper continued to evolve. In the 1920s, the \"flapper slipper\" became popular among young women, who wore them with short skirts and bare legs. The slipper also became a popular accessory for men, who wore them with casual clothing such as slacks and sweaters.\n\nToday, the slipper is a popular footwear choice for both men and women, and is available in a wide range of styles and materials. From luxurious fur-lined slippers to practical slip-ons, the slipper has become an essential part of many people's wardrobes.","rejected":"The slipper, or the \"slipper sock\" as it was originally called, has a long and storied history that dates back to the 16th century.

The slipper became popular in Europe during the Renaissance and was often worn by royalty.\n\nIn the 18th century, the slipper became more of a fashion accessory than a functional piece of footwear. Women began wearing them indoors as a way to protect their expensive shoes from dirt and damage. Slippers became even more popular in the 19th century, with many different materials and designs being used.\n\nThe modern slipper, as we know it today, was born in the early 20th century. Slippers became more comfortable and casual, with the addition of soft woolen fabrics and cushioned soles. This trend continued throughout the 20th century, with slippers becoming a staple in every home.\n\nToday, slippers are available in a wide variety of materials, styles, and colors.

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\nThe Guernsey is a breed of dairy cattle from the island of Guernsey in the Channel Islands. It is fawn or red and white in colour, and is hardy and docile. Its milk is rich in flavour, high in fat and protein, and has a golden-yellow tinge due to its high \u03b2-carotene content. The Guernsey is one of three Channel Island cattle breeds, the others being the Alderney \u2013 now extinct \u2013 and the Jersey.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Guernsey was bred on the British Channel Island of Guernsey; it is first documented in the nineteenth century, and its origins are unknown. Cattle were brought to the island in the Middle Ages for draught work. It has been suggested that the Guernsey derives from cattle imported from the French mainland \u2013 brindled cattle from Normandy, and wheaten stock similar to the Froment du L\u00e9on of Brittany. There may also have been some influence from Dutch cattle in the eighteenth century. During that century large numbers of cattle were exported from the Channel Islands to England; some of them had previously been brought from France. Imports of French cattle to Guernsey were forbidden by law in 1819, but some importation of British cattle continued until 1877. Some cattle evacuated from Alderney during the Second World War were merged into the breed.\n\nExports of cattle and semen were for a while an important economic resource for the island, and in the early 20th century, a large number of Guernsey cattle were exported to the United States. The Guernsey breed is on the watch list maintained by the American Livestock Breeds Conservancy, with fewer than 2,500 annual registrations in the U.S. and an estimated global population less than 10,000 animals.\n\nCharacteristics \n\nThe Guernsey is of medium size: cows weigh , and bulls . The coat is red or fawn (wheat-coloured), and may or may not be pied red-and-white or fawn-and-white. The Guernsey produces rich and flavoursome milk. It traditionally had several other good qualities: it was long-lived, calved without difficulty, grazed well and \u2013 being relatively small-sized \u2013  was an efficient milk producer. These advantages have been compromised by recent selective breeding strategies, which have led to larger animals, with longer legs. These no longer display the traditional qualities of the breed; this is particularly marked where there has been cross-breeding with Holstein-Friesian stock.\n\nUse \n\nThe Guernsey is a dairy breed, and generally is reared for that purpose only. However, the cow is usually removed from the dairy herd around ages six to eight, and marketed for beef, and other processed meats. The milk has a golden-yellow tinge due to a high content of \u03b2-carotene, a provitamin for vitamin A. The milk also has a high butterfat content of 5% and a high protein content of 3.7%.

But you do not need it,\" he said reprovingly, \"when you have Me.

It seemed a silly thing to do, considering the situation we were in, but it was just one night of escapism.\n\nWe talked about our childhood and it appeared that Emma wasn't local. She had moved to Lichfield a few years ago.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nLucy Lippard\u2014a giant of American art criticism, author of more than 20 books, and co-founder of Printed Matter, the quintessential seller of books made by artists\u2014turned 80 this year. Despite her multitude of other accomplishments, Lippard is best known for \u201cThe Dematerialization of Art,\u201d an essay she co-authored in 1968 with John Chandler (available online here.) In the essay, Lippard presented evidence that art might be entering a phase of pure intellectualism, the result of which could be the complete disappearance of the traditional art object. The piece grew out of, and helped contextualize, the preceding decade or so of wildly inventive conceptual art, which often left behind only ephemeral, non-archival relics, or no relics at all other than perhaps recordings of experiences. Conceptual artists were devoted to making ideas the central focus of their work, and many argued convincingly that the objects artists make to express their ideas are nothing but waste products, and that the ideas themselves are the only things worthy of consideration. The essay was enormously influential at the time: so much so that Lippard followed it up with a book called Six Years, extensively analyzing evidence of the trend. But obviously in the long run her premonition was inaccurate since art objects still have yet to dematerialize. Nonetheless, in celebration of the upcoming 50th anniversary of the original publication of The Dematerialization of Art, we thought we would take a moment to delve into this influential essay and highlight what about it is relevant for our time.\n\nLippard based the core concepts she discussed in The Dematerialization of Art on an idea first laid out in a book called The Mathematical Basis of the Arts, written by the American painter Joseph Schillinger. In that book, Schillinger divided all of art history into five categories of aesthetic phenomena. First, he explained, came the \u201cpre-aesthetic\u201d phase of mimicry. Next came ritualistic or religious art. Then came emotional art. Then rational, empirical-based art. And then the fifth, and allegedly \u201cfinal\u201d aesthetic phase described by Schillinger was \u201cscientific,\u201d or what he called \u201cpost-aesthetic.\u201d This final phase, he predicted, would culminate in the \u201cliberation of the idea\u201d and lead to the \u201cdisintegration of art.\u201d\n\nWhile contemplating the evolution of art throughout the 1950s and 60s, Lippard believed what she was witnessing was the emergence of this fifth phase of art. And she was excited about the notion. She considered dematerialization a positive, vital shift. After all, if the aesthetic object could cease to exist as the central focus of art then art could be freed from commodification, the often vile system that exerts so much destructive force on the lives and work of many artists.\n\nAs evidence that dematerialization had begun, Lippard cited movements such as Light and Space, which were visual but not object-based, and Minimalism, which drastically pared down the aesthetic object. Such movements she believed diminished the importance of the visual aspect of an artwork, defining the visual as more of a jumping-off point for an immaterial, intellectual experience. But one of the early, and obvious, criticisms of The Dematerialization of Art was that even though these ephemeral, conceptual concepts were less object-based, they still nonetheless resulted in physical phenomena. Even a performance artist creates a thing\u2014a performance\u2014which can be sold as an experience, or recorded.\n\nNo matter how slight a relic an artist creates, it can become fetishized and traded as a commodity. The only way to completely avoid the possibility of commodification is to never share an idea: then perhaps the reverence and sanctity of the intellectual experience can be preserved. But only shared ideas can truly be called art. And as soon as an idea is shared, it can be possessed, manipulated, and expressed in other ways, or other words, materialized. And as soon as something materializes it can be bought and sold as a commodity.\n\n Re-reading The Dematerialization of Art today, the only true error that seems evident is how it presents the five phases of art, as explained by Schillinger, as something linear. It is always tempting for each generation to see itself as standing at the forefront of modernity. Schillinger thought art had been progressing historically through phases, and Lippard thought she was part of the generation that was advancing art toward its evolutionary apex. But time does not move forward; it just passes. Culture is not linear; it repeats itself. Humanity devolves as rapidly as it evolves. And the truth was in the 1960s and 70s, and still is today, that artists are finding ways to dematerialize as rapidly as others are rediscovering how to materialize it.\n\nUltimately, Lippard must have also realized this even as she wrote on the topic of dematerialization because her essay concludes by asking if the so-called zero point in art is likely to be reached soon. The answer, she states, is, \u201cIt hardly seems likely.\u201d Even today as artists sell virtual creations that exist only in digital space, we can still argue dematerialization is a fantasy. Anything that can be seen is by definition material, even if it can only be seen through virtual reality goggles. But in our opinion that only proves that perhaps achieving dematerialization was never really the point. The point Lippard was truly making was simply that one important aspect of visual art is to engage tirelessly in the search to discover how to express more with less. Any artist working toward dematerialization is also working toward simplicity. And simplicity leads to the discovery of what is truly indispensable, and thus truly meaningful. That is not the final phase of art. But it is capable of reminding us what the value of art truly is.\n###\nIs the writing style of this piece formal or informal, and what effect does it have on the reader?

{"prompt":"Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nChurches cannot provide you with an experience of God on a personal level. Only God can reveal Himself to you. The perspective of others can open doors of possibilities, but real truth is only of God and from God.\n\nThe experience of church can serve to open your thoughts to the experiences of others. God is only experienced one-on-one. Do not assume that hearing words read or explained from the Bible will offer you God. God seeks that you know Him as He truly is and not as He is interpreted from words. Just as hearing about something is not the same as experiencing it, the same is true of God. The experience of God is different for every person \u2013 fitting specifically the needs of each person. Hearing about the experiences of others can cause you to believe that you are less because you have not had miracles or revelations. Your personal experience must be your own. All levels of learning and understanding create the need for teaching on an individual basis. What is understood by me would not necessarily benefit you if you had the same experience. Don't assume that a person who claims to speak to God is in any way greater or better than you. For all that is required to hear God's voice is the willingness to listen. You don't need a church, or a temple or a shrine to hear God's voice. In fact, it is rather hard to hear God while someone else is speaking or the choir is singing. I made it a practice to spend time alone with God without distractions. There is no substitute for God time. Do yourself a favor and get quiet and listen to God. He speaks to all, all the time. Do you listen? When was the last time you heard God speak?\n\nThe unraveling of the illusion happens in stages. An instant of total awareness would be shocking to your mind and would prove to be counter productive. This would be like being wakened from a deep sleep by having cold water poured on you. The shock would render the experience useless. God has chosen a more merciful awakening - a slowly, carefully offered eye opening on various levels. It has taken you years to get to your present frame of mind \u2013 would a sudden shock benefit your understanding? The process of unlearning can be quite disconcerting for the seeker. It seems as if the whole world is turned upside down and you no longer have a grip on your foundation. You feel that you are without the building blocks that had formed your belief system. Your belief house is slowly dismantled, brick by brick, until you are open to all possibilities. At this point, you can build a house based on truth and not illusion. God will give you the bricks of truth with which to construct your house of truth. The house of truth is the only indestructible house you ever build. My house was built on truth and inside of it did I find comfort and solace. The world is built on illusions of greatness of materiality. All these houses fall eventually, just as all the great empires have fallen. But, God's truth stands firm for all eternity. But, you must first get out of the house of illusion before you can build the house of truth.\n\nThe unlearning and rebuilding process is often tedious and time consuming. Were the process fully understood up front, it would be far less chosen than it already is. But, the call to return to the perfection of God is universal and all must face the arduous journey home.\n###\n\nWhich religious denomination, if any, would this text be most associated with?","chosen":"This text is not associated with any particular religious denomination, as it discusses a personal experience of God that is unique to the author.

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\nIt could be sunny in the morning, raining an hour later, alternating sunshine and pouring hail throughout the afternoon, then end the day with snow. Icelandic architecture was not a pretty sight. The outer walls of their homes were made of ribbed metal plates locked in place with screws. Certainly, it resisted the tear and wear of rainfall, snow, and heavy storms, but it made the homes, both here as well as in the capital of Reykjavik, look generic. They looked like construction workers' canteens, similar to those steel cargo crates hauled off a mammoth ship and transported further inland on trucks.\n\nThese metal-plated dwellings looked nothing like the longhouses of the Viking Age, made of wood and overgrown with moss and grass. If modern transportation hadn't arrived to bring the Icelanders their imported building materials, I suspected there wouldn't have been people living on the island today. By now, the descendants of the Old Norse settlers would have felled every tree. It would have turned Iceland into another Easter Island. Perhaps, in a futile attempt to draw the world's attention, the Icelanders, too, would have erected strange staring stones facing Norway, crying, \"We're stuck here! Help us!\"\n\nModernity did arrive, eventually. The island people have managed to keep a healthy distance from its influences. A well-known American fast-food chain once attempted to establish a flagship store in the capital, but the locals refused to eat there. They would rather drink milk straight from a cow than consume foodstuffs produced at the lowest cost in the world. The place went bankrupt. The last hamburger sold was put on display in a museum under a cheese dome. A decade later, the thing still refused to decompose, confirming the locals' belief it wasn't real food.\n\nI remembered Egilssta\u00f0ir was named after one of Iceland's famous heroes, Egil Skallagrimson, literally Egil, son of the bald-headed one. This historical figure started killing people when he was a child, then embarked on a life-long career of murder and plunder. From what I remembered reading, Egil's father had angered his son by doubting his strength. So, a seven-year-old Egil stormed out of the house and murdered one of his father's farmworkers. In response, his angered father threw the housemaid off a cliff into the cold waters below. He dunked a rock on her head to make sure she would die and drown.\n\nSuch characters naturally became national heroes, which, to me, made perfect sense. Nobody will ever remember the guys who used to check the stamps on people's outgoing mail before computer scanners took their jobs. Nobody will ever honor a checkout girl as her nation's heroin, no matter how many billions of items she handled without error. Nobody cares about the guy who writes the books. People care about the hero, for he shows us we still possess strengths. In times of great stresses and turmoil, it is to those strengths we must return if we wish to survive. We all know it's true.\n\nModern men could learn a thing or two from the old Vikings. If you were a fertile young woman who encountered such a man at a drinking festival, and he seated himself next to you demanding that you sail to Iceland with him to be his wife, you would say yes or he would kill you. You wouldn't dare to play head games with men who had killed forty on their way home from work. These were men who clubbed their last enemy to death with the other arm they had lost in a swordfight. No, a girl wouldn't think of refusing such a man's sexual advances. She would reward him for choosing her and the next summer, she would bear his child.\n\nEgil was a manhunter. He would sail back to Norway to hunt, rob, and kill Laplanders for a couple of months each summer until he grew tired of it. For the sport. Men were wolves back then, utterly incomparable to the sissified weasels modern materialist culture has conditioned men to be. If a group of men from our time somehow got lost in a Nordic storm and were transported back to the Viking Age, they would be ridiculed and killed. Men, I thought, should become real men again. They should be hunters, warriors, and killers, and they should go on razzias to rob the prettiest girls from their father's homes.\n\nThere is, however, a misconception about the ancients that they were, supposedly, a lawless people. Though the Icelanders founded the world's first parliament, they obviously didn't have a police force or a national army to keep the population in check. They didn't have TV and radio to infect people's minds with government lies. In the old time, few successful strongmen might have gathered bands of men to fight on their behalf, but these would have ranged in the dozens, at most, certainly not in the thousands.\n\nYour task is to:\nWhat is the main theme or topic of this passage?","chosen":"The main theme of this passage is the contrast between the modern and ancient ways of life in Iceland, with a focus on the country's architecture, food, and culture. The author highlights the unique challenges faced by the Icelandic people, such as the country's harsh weather conditions and the need to maintain a healthy distance from modern influences.

That matters not. The important thing is what we do in the valley and most importantly what we do with our minds when in this place, ensuring that we keep focussed on Him and not the circumstances.\n\nYou will keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on You, because he trusts in You. (Isaiah 26:3, NKJV)\n\nWrite\n\nIn my case, it was writing \u2013 I was to write in the valley. I knew that, God had told me that at the start; to 'write my way out of the valley.' Without that clear guidance I really don't know how or when I would have got out.\n\nIn the process of coming out of the valley I knew time was pressing on and something was telling me to get this book written, that I didn't have much time (whatever that meant). But at the same time, I was saying, 'God, what is the outcome? What is the end? What is the focus now for this book? Is it complete healing and glory to God or a calling home?' Whichever it was, I knew it needed to be finished for others to benefit and for me to move forward either in this life or the life to come.\n\nIt was a lonely process at times and I got frustrated when I felt those closest to me didn't understand; the gastric issues, vision for the book and me in general, but we have to remember that ultimately God is first and what He thinks is what really matters. He is the only one who will love us unconditionally, not judge us, not ignore us and truly care for us. Each of our journeys and ways out of the valley are unique, and others may not understand, but fix your eyes on God.\n\nAs the scripture says;\n\nIf God is for us, who can be against us?\n\n(Romans 8:31, NKJV)\n\nWe so often beat ourselves up when we get frustrated and are so hard on ourselves \u2013 why do I act like that?

As God said;\n\nBe angry, and do not sin... (Ephesians 4:26, NKJV)\n\nWe just have to give these emotions to God daily so they don't control us.\n\nFor God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power, and of love and of a sound mind.

{"prompt":"Reference:\nHe pushed my stricken face right up to the green clay figure. I stood horrified as the three-pointed face began to come to life, beginning to speak in some ancient foreign language. I thought that perhaps it was Hebrew, but I couldn't be certain. The clay figure chanted for some short time; the sound was almost as terrifying to listen to as the unnatural sight of it coming to life was to my unbelieving eyes. Then, without warning, the figure became silent. The wooden door vanished, and I found myself in a small, claustrophobic room. It was the office of Vladimir Pavlovich, and I would have given anything to be somewhere else.\n\nIt was not well-furnished, this study of Vladimir's. A small wooden desk rested against a wall with filthy, peeling paint. A medium-sized picture of Russian Czar Nicholas II and his wife Alexandra hung prominently on this wall. On the opposite side of the room was a large painting of a mysteriously dark man. It contrasted sharply with the bright gold-colored wallpaper on which it hung. The man in the painting had long black greasy hair, deep penetrating eyes, and a thick scruffy beard. He wore the long black cloak of a Russian mystic. His right hand was raised, as if he were performing some strange ritual. There was no mistaking this haunting image---it was Rasputin!\n\nThere was old Cyrillic writing visible on the wall, right above the painting. I tried to read some of it, but it was hopelessly muddled. If I had to guess, I would have considered that it was some kind of chant or spell. Under the letters were various groups of numbers. They seemed to be organized into some sort of pattern; the same letters seemed to repeat themselves in a recognizable form. Despite myself, I couldn't help wondering what connection there was between the Cyrillic letters and the standard numbers. Was this the Kabbalah that Nicholas had spoken of on previous occasions? What did it all mean?\n\nI rubbed the arm that Ivan had gripped too tightly. Fortunately, he had relinquished his grip when I had entered the room. I looked around the chamber, but could see no sign of the bully. From the corner of my eye I spotted a crumpled up figure lying prostrate on the floor. At first I thought it was a wolf, or some wild dog with black fur. As I strained my eyes, adjusting them to the haziness of the room, I suddenly recognized the unmoving figure. It was Alexander! He was lying collapsed on the floor, perhaps even dead!\n\nI ran over to the still body of Alexander Pavlovich. I touched his arm, frightened at the possibility of finding him cold to the touch, like a corpse. However, I was happy to discover that he was still warm. I turned over his head, attempting to examine him more closely. His black hair still hung loosely over his closed eyes. His tongue lolled strangely out of swollen lips. Alexander was definitely unconscious; it appeared as if he had been drugged.\n\nFrom the shadows of the room, a sudden movement caught my eye. It was a large shape, materializing like some ghost from the grave. I gave a quick cry as a shock ran through my body. The figure slowly began to take on a more recognizable, human form. I regarded blondish-grey hair, old-fashioned eyeglasses and a gentle sneer that I knew all too well. It was Harriet!\n\nI rushed over and hugged her large frame. She returned my greeting, patting me on the head and gently rubbing my hand. I was so glad to find her alive that I wept tears of joy. Harriet wiped my eyes clean, smiling at me in her familiar reassuring way.\n\n\"Where you been, Harriet?\" I asked her. \"I being so worried you...\" my voice trailed.\n\n\"Dead?\" Harriet's voice seemed to gently mock me. She affectionately placed her arm around my shoulders, gently guiding me to the door. I was feeling very relieved. Now that Harriet was alive and well, I felt that everything would be just fine.\n\n\"I tell you before, Sonia,\" she said warmly. \"You are needing more confidence. Believe in yourself...you are doing great things,\" she advised me. I turned my head back in the direction of Alexander. He was beginning to move a little, though not without difficulty. He gave a low moan of pain, his eyes still remaining closed as he continued to lie on the dirty wooden floor.\n\n\"Harriet,\" I said in confusion. \"Shouldn't we be helping Alexander? He's being very hurt,\" I remarked with concern.\n\nThe eyes behind the old-fashioned glasses unexpectedly changed expression.

It is in a classical format with strict rules on the meter of quatrains called slokas or mukthaka. A number of scholars sit to recite either Sanskrit or Malayalam slokas ( with more than eight letters in a line ). Once the recitation is started the next one in the turn has to recite a sloka having the first letter of the third line of the previous sloka. This resembles the north Indian Beit bazi.\n\nIt is mostly unused, but is active as the forerunner of the present day Anthakshari (\u0d05\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d30\u0d3f).

Koonammoochi aksharaslokavedi and Ariyannur aksharaslokakalakshethram are worth mentioning for their contribution in the field of publishing many books related to aksharaslokam like aksharasloka directory (the first ever and the only one till date) containing names and addresses of aksharasloka artists. There are many active groups in Kerala from Kozhikode to Thiruvananthapuram with Trichur as the hub of the revival. There is a magazine dedicated for slokam called Kavana Kauthukam published from Trichur.

Aksharaslokam is an item in the prestigious school youth festival of Kerala.\n\nCompetitions \n\n \nOne of the prominent Aksharaslokam competitions is the one held in connection with the Thrissur Pooram.  Traditionally this competition was called the \"Chakolas Gold Medal\".  Eventually it has been renamed now as \"V. Kamalakara Menon Suvarna Mudra\". The first winner of the Chakolas Gold Medal was late U.P. Raghava Warrier, popularly known as UPR. That was in 1955. The second position was won by Late Chengamanad Damodaran Nambiar. The four artists who survived till the end included late N.D.Krishnan Unni and Late Kamalakara Menon. The judges were Sri.Puthezhath Raman Menon, \nKunjunni Raja and K. Vasudevan Moosad.  As per tradition, participants who have won the Gold Medal once do not participate in the competitions again. Currently, separate competitions are held for groups separated as per their age. The Government of Kerala conducts prestigious competitions for children in connection with school yuvajanotsavams (youth festivals). The Guruvayoor Devaswam conducts two prominent competitions with gold medal as first prize. One is Sree Guruvayoorappan suvarna mudra on Guruvayoor Ekadasi day.

Almost all multiple fatalities in rafting, kayaking and canoeing are due to weirs.\nAccidents involving Weirs in Europe:\n2008 \u2013 5 soldiers drown rafting on the Kander river in Switzerland\n2008 \u2013 13 people drown in a weir while canoeing on the Sava river in Slovenia\n1999 \u2013 4 UK tourists drown commercially rafting on the Salzach river in Austria\n1993 \u2013 9 German tourists die rafting on the Inn river in Engadine, Switzerland\n1975 \u2013 10 soldiers drown at Cromwell Weir on the river Trent in England\nWeirs are so dangerous because even with correct swiftwater rescue training and equipment, if the weir has sufficient towback, it will be almost impossible to self rescue from. Looking at these accidents we can class them into different accident types:\n1. Ignorance of the danger\nThe accidents that occurred on the Kander, Sava and Inn rivers where all, to a large extent, caused by a ignorance of the danger posed by the weirs. Most weirs look very tame compared to sections of whitewater, and the amount of aerated water bears no relation to the amount of towback that will be present. Changes in water level can also account for changes in the amount of towback at a weir. This was the case on the Inn, where the group had successfully run the weir the day before, when less water was flowing.\nIgnorance can also mean not knowing that there is a weir (or other deadly feature) on the section of river that you are paddling. In 2010 a party of 4 Russian rafters died in Norway when they put in on the wrong section of the Sjoa river, one where the whole river flows through a siphon.\nif there is any doubt that a weir (or rapid) is dangerous, then it should always be portaged.\n2. Missing the take out\nThe other two accidents were caused by the rafts missing the take out. On the Trent this was during a military night exercise, on the Salzach when a guest fell out of the raft during landing. This can also be a problem when unrunnable gorges or hard rapids are downstream. Always have everyone look at the take out when there is such a deadly hazard downstream, and get out a good distance above it.\nIt is far better to walk an extra 200m than miss the last eddy! During night exercises lights positioned to show the end of the exercise area are needed to prevent people continuing downstream and into other hazards.\nPeople often find it difficult to assess the danger posed by a man made weir, unless they are very experienced in understanding swiftwater. The Environmental agency in Great Britain needed to assess the danger that weirs on rivers posed to the public. Take a look at this comprehensive weir assessment system that Rescue 3 UK developed to help them with this difficult task.\nThe system is divided up into 4 sections:\n1. Weir hazard rating\n2. Likelihood of weir to cause harm rating\n3. Weir risk rating (1 x 2)\n4. Weir rescue rating\nThe Weir Hazard rating looks at 10 structural factors of the weir such as \u2013 the amount of towback, depth of hydraulic, height of the drop, etc. Each factor is then rated with points from 0 to 5, and all the points added up for a total score.\nLikelihood to cause harm tries to work out if anyone will be able to get stuck in the weir and looks at all the different ways that could happen. Again each factor gets a point score, which are added up for the overall rating.\nThe risk rating is produced by multiplying the hazard by the likelihood.\nLastly is the Rescue rating, it looks at 10 points that influence the ease of rescue such as \u2013 width of river, access on the banks, available anchors etc.\nAll in all it is a very good system especially for users who have very little experience of swiftwater rescue. Some people may find it\u2019s mathematical nature a bit overly complex, as it takes a while to add all the points up. Others may ask why is there a need for likelihood and risk ratings. Don\u2019t forget this system was developed mainly to prevent people from drowning in weirs and not just for rescue requirements.\n\nwhat are the primary reasons why weirs are considered dangerous, and what are some of the key factors that contribute to accidents involving weirs? Additionally, please summarize how the weir assessment system developed by Rescue 3 UK can help in evaluating the risks associated with a weir.","chosen":"Weirs are considered extremely dangerous because of the high risk of getting stuck in the weir and the difficulty of self-rescue, especially if the weir has sufficient towback.

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nTaking Vitamin D at the right time of the day may have a significant impact on how well it is absorbed and how effective it is, writes Dr Monish Raut\n\nVitamin D is an extremely essential vitamin and those suffering from Vitamin D deficiency, often complain of experiencing general tiredness and weakness, limiting them from going about their daily functions. Taking supplements may help improve energy levels as there are relatively few foods that contain vitamin D and it is quite difficult to get this vitamin through diet alone. Vitamin D is one of the most often prescribed nutritional supplement since so many people are vulnerable to vitamin D insufficiency across the globe. A number of variables may affect how effective the medication is for you, such as when and how you take it each day. Taking vitamin D at the right time of the day may have a significant impact on how well it is absorbed and how effective it is. As a hormone, vitamin D differs from other vitamins because your skin produces it when exposed to sunshine. Vitamin D is crucial to your health since studies have shown that it may have a role in immunological function, bone health, cancer prevention, and more. There are just a few dietary options that can satisfy your vitamin D requirements if you don't spend a lot of time outside. The risk of vitamin D insufficiency is significantly greater among the elderly, those with a darker complexion, those who are obese, and those who reside in places with low sunshine. Vitamin D deficiency affects 70% to 90% of Indians, according to research. A simple and efficient strategy to ensure that you're getting enough vitamin D is to take a supplement.\n\nIs there increased absorption when combined with meals?\n\nIn order to get the most out of your vitamin D supplement, you need to consume foods that are rich in fat, such as oily fish or nuts. As a result, vitamin D pills should be taken with a meal in order to maximise absorption. After only 2\u20133 months of taking vitamin D with the main meal of the day, vitamin D blood levels jumped by roughly 50%, according to research. Another research found that supplementing with vitamin D after a high-fat meal boosted vitamin D blood levels by 32% after 12 hours, compared to a fat-free meal. Nutritional fats like avocados and full-fat dairy products, as well as eggs, nuts, and seeds, may help your body absorb vitamin D more effectively.\n\nIs it better to make it a part of your morning routine?\n\nMany individuals choose to begin their day with supplements such as vitamin D. There are several reasons why it's more convenient and simpler to remember to take your vitamins in the morning than at other times. For those taking many supplements, this is particularly relevant since it may be difficult to scatter them all through the day, especially if you are taking various medicines. That's why you may want to start taking your vitamin D pill with a nutritious meal every morning.\n\nLate-day use may interfere with sleep: Myth or fact?\n\nVitamin D levels have been linked to a person's ability to have a good night's sleep. Lack of vitamin D has been linked to a greater incidence of sleep disorders, a worse level of sleep quality and an overall shorter sleep time, according to various research. On the other hand, another research found that increased vitamin D levels were associated with decreased melatonin levels in persons with multiple sclerosis. Melatonin is the hormone that regulates your sleep cycle. At night, consuming vitamin D has been reported to interfere with the generation of melatonin which has been linked to worse sleep quality. However, there is presently no scientific evidence to support the idea that taking vitamin D supplements at night might impact sleep. It may be wise to explore and discover what performs better for you before there are any studies to back it up.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nSummarize the text about vitamin D timing of use for medical students in 5 bullet points.","chosen":"- When is the best time to take vitamin D?\nThe best time to take vitamin D is with the main meal of the day.

I am saving and crossing over all sentient beings.\n\nI am here to tell everyone, as Buddhists, we must know our future, we must correct our wrongdoings of the past, we must change our present, and we must let go of attachments to ourselves. This is because our fate and fortune are changeable. We must immediately let go of attachments to ourselves, and not think too much. Today is today, and tomorrow is tomorrow. Today is not equivalent to tomorrow, and tomorrow is not equivalent to today. As long as we have the right mindset, we are worthy of our conscience.

Living in this world, who wouldn't want to change themselves? But it is very difficult to change yourself, very tiring, and very painful. So please remember, as Buddhists, we need to know how to change ourselves. As I said before, the first thing is to let go of attachments to yourself, and second is that you should repent yourself. The calamities and disasters that we have experienced in the past and the negative karmas that we have generated in the past, they have been with us for a long period of time.\n\nYesterday when I gave a Dharma Talk to my disciples, the first thing I said was: suppose you have a dirty item, the longer you keep it on your body, the greater the harm that it will bring to you.

{"prompt":"The following information may be useful:\n<start of reference>\nFluid accumulation in the ear that results in obstructions and inflammation is the primary cause of ear infections. Our ear is divided into the inner ear, middle ear, and outer ear. Even though any of these areas can be infected, bacterial infections of the inner ear are highly unusual. Bacteria, viruses, and fungi can cause ear infections when they enter one of the three areas of the ear. Colds and allergies may trigger ear infections as well. In most cases, ear infections will go away on their own in a week or two.\n\nAdults with different types of ear infections will receive different treatments from your ENT doctor. Swimmer\u2019s ear, also known as otitis externa, is another name for outer ear infections. Typically, outer ear infections occur in the ear canal, which extends from the outside of the ear to the eardrum. Outer ear infections could result from swimming, taking a bath in water that is not clean, or damaged skin that has an open wound. When a moist environment supports the growth of these organisms, infection is typically the result.\n\nThe middle ear travels from behind the eardrum to the oval window (the area between the middle ear and inner ear). The middle ear has three little bones, known as ossicles, which are critical for hearing. The Eustachian tube, also known as the auditory tube, connects the middle ear to the throat. The purpose of the eustachian tube is to circulate air and balance the pressure in the middle ear. The fluid in the middle ear area drains into the throat.\n\nMiddle ear infections usually follow an upper respiratory infection or a cold. Middle ear infections also occur in people with allergies or enlarged adenoids (tissue in the throat and nasal cavity), which can damage the auditory tube\u2019s proper operation. The auditory tube is the entry point for bacteria or viruses. As a result, the auditory tube may swell and become mucus-blocked, obstructing middle ear drainage and ventilation.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nPlease provide a concise summary focused on the causes and contributing factors of ear infections in adults, as explained in the resource.

One of them, Beverly (Jessica Hynes), is a housewife who works as a cleaner at the police station and has failed her driving exams eight times, mainly because her husband Ian (Shaun Dingwall) is too impatient giving her driving lessons. She decides to take driving lessons from Chris (David Tennant), a devout Christian driving instructor at Gear Change, with whom she falls in love. However Chris loves his boss Fiona (Sarah Hadland) who is having an affair with Beverly's colleague, policeman Gerry.\n\nBeverly tries to raise cash for her driving lessons, because Ian spent all their money on a pair of owls, hoping to sell their offspring for a profit. She ends up looting her daughter's savings for university. During her ninth secret driving test, she runs into Ian on the street, thus failing again. To make matters worse, Chris leaves Gear Change, because Fiona has an affair with Gerry, leaving all learner drivers without their favourite teacher.

The team gives the students experience in various skill sets in robotics, engineering, programing, design and applied electronics. \u201cI have loved every minute of it. It teaches them so much in a lot of different specialties,\u201d said Kerle.\n\nThe team works together to design, fabricate and program an industrial sized robot to compete in the FIRST Robotics Competition. They are given the challenge parameters and have six to eight weeks to prepare their creation. Numerous regional events lead to a championship with 3,304 teams coming from 31 countries with over 82,600 youth members. \u201cOne of the most important things about participating in this club is that it teaches the students how to act with graciousness and professionalism. No matter who you face as an opponent always be gracious and professional as you never know who may be your colleague in the future,\u201d said Kerle.\n\nScience, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) has been a focus in Washington state education since 2013. \u201cSTEM students are the future. Clubs like these gives them the groundwork in so many fields to help them in their futures,\u201d said Kerle. The state has developed the STEM Education Innovation Alliance which has worked to invest in these areas and strongly encourage growth in clubs like these.\n\nThe class was able to tour TRFB and look at many of the skilled trades practiced here including: Electric, Paint, Plating, Pipefitting and Shipfitters. One of those shops was Kerle\u2019s own photonics and periscopes where the students learned about the various optic processes and got to see a Type 18 periscope which is almost fully electrical. They were also introduced to a field fox that is used to perform radio frequency testing on the periscopes. \"It's really amazing to see all of the incredible work being done local to our school district,\u201d said Blake Greisinger, team coach.\n\nThey capped off their tour of TRFB with a visit to the command suite where they demonstrated a few of their latest creations for senior command leaders. Their creations showed off the hard work of the team and displayed various abilities including: controlled projectile launching, retroreflective vision tracking and a complex and powerful swerve drive that can translate and rotate the robot in any direction at any time.\n\nThe commanding officer and the leadership team shared an overview of the TRFB mission and some of the diversity of STEM principles used in our shops. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget that our community is so valuable for our success. We must support programs like these and also acknowledge the tremendous contribution of one of our own in supporting STEM education and the future of these students,\u201d said Capt. Mike Eberlein, commanding officer, TRFB.\n\n\u201cThese students are the engineers and tradespeople of the future. It is fantastic to be able to introduce them to real world applications of these subjects as they grow their education,\u201d said Cmdr. Zach Harry, executive officer, TRFB.\n\nUnfortunately, scheduling conflicts had to postpone a submarine tour on this visit, but the command went to work for the kids and was able to coordinate a tour and demonstration with Unmanned Undersea Vehicle Squadron One. \u201cThe trip was really cool. I thought that the [unmanned undersea vehicles] were very cool and really enjoyed the whole tour. I learned how robotics is connected to many jobs and how it prepares me for those types of jobs in the future,\u201d said student Noah Kroeker.\n\nAs the students boarded their bus for the return trip to school, the excited buzz was contagious.\n\nKerle is already coordinating a return trip to get the kids a submarine tour.\n\nThe mentorship of Kerle is supported by TRFB with volunteer hours as well as the Department of Defense Stem Outreach Program. \u201cScience, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has been recognized by the DOD as a priority that starts in elementary school. STEM Outreach strives to attract and cultivate STEM talent throughout the education continuum to enrich our future workforce,\u201d said Diana Palermo, Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility STEM Outreach Coordinator.\n\n\u201cTyler is the kind of person that wants to help everyone else grow.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nThe concolor fir is a medium growing (12 inches per year) compact evergreen. Its needles are 11\/2 inches long and are positioned on the topside of the stem and point upwards. They are usually a green blue silver color and when crushed have a smell of citrus or oranges and is quite pleasant. It does not shed its needles but hold them for 10 years or longer, and holds its bottom branches to the ground. It is a native of the high plains, low humidity, rocky mountain areas from New Mexico to Wyoming and commonly grows with the Colorado spruce and Douglas Fir.\n\nThe concolor fir will grow 30 to 100 ft tall and 15 to 25 feet wide and has a shallow spreading root system. Its branches are not quite as strong as spruces but with its pyramid shape, snow and ice usually cause little damage. In the wild this tree can live 100 years and longer but outside of its normal range one could expect 40 or more years to be an old tree. Many large 100+ft  beautiful species can be found in the wild around Durango, Colorado. Deer will eat this species when other preferred browse is unavailable.\n\nThe concolor fir will grow in hardiness zones from 3-6 and will do quite well in poor dry soils, but should not be planted in clay or poorly drained soils. Does well with 15\u201d of rain per year and does well in higher soil PH than any other Fir. I have seen many beautiful plants growing along gravel roads where the soil PH had to be above 9.\n\nThe concolor fir has been planted throughout the US and is used mainly for landscaping. Has been planted in the past in windbreaks because of its nice color and availability. This tree needs a well drained soil to do well, in most places east of Nebraska has not done well in the long term for windbreaks as we get too much rain and humidity.  When planted on level ground that is not well drained problems occur on wet years. The roots become too saturated and die back occurs and have seen 20 ft tall tree blow over and the root system is very small being only 3 ft across. Problems with canker and needlecast diseases can also occur when planted too close in windbreaks restricting sun and wind. For best results plant on a well drained soil and open the spacing up if planting outside its natural range.\n\nA 2-ft tall-potted tree can be 6 ft tall in 5 years, in well-drained soil with adequate moisture, and weed and grass control around the base of the tree. Spacing--single row 16 ft apart, Double row 16 ft between rows and plants, Multiple rows-- 20 ft or more between plants and rows.\n\nThe white (concolor) fir is not a recommended windbreak tree east of Nebraska. In multiple row windbreaks east of Nebraska life will be short due to spacing. soil, and disease problems..  It can be a beautiful tree, and if you love this tree, plant one in your back yard and one in your front yard but plant other species in your windbreak if east of Nebraska.  We do not consider this to be a recommended long life windbreak tree east of Nebraska.\n\nConcolor fir do not like being grown in Pots, so what we have available are bare root transplants.\n###\nGiven the text that describes the height of a Concolor Fir, I'm trying to figure out if one will fit the plot in my backyard over the course of 15 years. The plot in my backyard is 50 feet by 50 feet, with no height restriction. Can you give me an explanation of the math behind how much my Concolor Fir will grow on average over 15 years if it starts out at 2 feet tall in a pot? The response should be a minimum of 150 words.","chosen":"Over the course of 15 years, a Concolor Fir that starts out at 2 feet tall in a pot can grow to an average height of 6 feet, which is 12 inches per year. If you plant the tree in well-drained soil and provide adequate moisture, weed, and grass control around the base of the tree, it can grow up to 2 feet per year. This means that in 15 years, the tree will grow to be approximately 15 feet tall, which is about as tall as a 3-story building.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that this is just an estimate, as the growth rate of a Concolor Fir can vary based on various factors such as the soil quality, temperature, and moisture levels. It's also worth considering that the tree may not grow at the same rate throughout its lifetime, and may slow down as it matures.\n\nIn addition, if you're planting the tree in a windbreak, it's important to space the trees properly to allow for adequate airflow and sunlight. Concolor Firs are not recommended for windbreaks east of Nebraska due to spacing, soil, and disease problems.\n\nOverall, if you want to plant a Concolor Fir in your backyard, it's important to carefully consider the tree's growth rate, potential for disease, and the soil quality in your area.","rejected":"You can use the growth rate of 12 inches per year as a guide. This will give you an average of 3 feet of growth per year, which will result in a total height of about 30 feet in 15 years. This is an average, and there may be years where the tree grows more or less than 3 feet. You should also consider the width of the tree, which can reach up to 25 feet. If you want to fit a Concolor Fir in your backyard, you should consider planting it on the edges of the plot or in a corner to allow enough space for the tree to grow."}

What are some things you can do to make it more bearable?\nJulieanna: I don't know...look for another job maybe?\nTherapist: That's definitely an option, but it's not always easy to find a new job. Especially in this economy. Have you considered talking to your boss about your concerns? See if there's anything that can be done to make your job more interesting or fulfilling for you.\nJulieanna: I don't know...I don't want to rock the boat too much.\nTherapist: It's worth a shot, Julieanna. If you're unhappy with your current situation, you need to do something about it. Otherwise, you'll just continue to feel stuck and resentful. And as for your relationship...it sounds like things have been pretty tough lately. What can you do to try and improve things between you and your partner?\nJulieanna: We've been talking about going to counseling, but I'm not sure if it will really help.\nTherapist: It might not hurt to give it a try. Communication is always important in relationships, but it sounds like it's been lacking lately. Would you be willing to go to counseling with your partner? Even if it's just a few sessions?\nJulieanna: I guess so...I mean, what do we have to lose at this point?\nTherapist: That's the right attitude, Julieanna. Just remember that things won't change overnight, but if you're both committed to working on things, there's a good chance things will get better eventually.\n<end of reference>\nPlease provide a prompt that requests the model to summarize the key points of this text.","chosen":"Please summarize the key points of this text.","rejected":"Hi"}

During the Second World War the division was notionally reactivated as part of Fortitude South II.\n\nHistory\n\nWorld War I\nThe 11th Division was first formed as a National Guard division in early 1917 consisting of units of the Michigan and Wisconsin National Guards. By the end of that same year, the 11th Division became the 32nd Division (later 32nd Infantry Division).\n\nThe 11th Division was reformed as a National Army division in August 1918, and was commanded briefly by Joseph Alfred Gaston before Jesse McI. Carter took over. The division was nicknamed the Lafayette Division, and its shoulder sleeve insignia included a silhouette of Lafayette. The 17th Infantry Regiment, and the 63rd Infantry Regiment were the two units chosen as the cadre around which the division would be formed. The 71st and 72nd Infantry Regiments were formed from cadres from the 17th and 63rd Regiments. The division's field artillery brigade was trained at West Point, Kentucky, and never actually joined the division at Camp Meade. The division's advanced schools detachment started for England on 25 October 1918, arriving 8 November 1918. With the Armistice, further activities were halted and the division disbanded on 29 November 1918 at Camp Meade, Maryland.\n\nWorld War II (deception formation)\n\nThe 11th Infantry Division was 'reformed' for a third time in 1944 as part of Operation Fortitude. A purely notional unit, in the deception it was depicted as intended to replace the real 4th Armored Division when the 4th Armored moved to Normandy.\n\nThe division was presented to the Germans as a well trained unit based in the area around Northwich, Cheshire with its headquarters located at Delamere House. When the 4th Armored Division moved to Normandy, the 11th Infantry Division was depicted as moving into the vacated quarters around Bury St Edmunds. There, as part of the (notional) US XXXIII Corps of the (notional) US 14th Army it was depicted as assigned the role of following up the Pas de Calais landings. In the aftermath of Fortitude South II the 11th Division was depicted as moving to Winchester in Hampshire during August, 1944.  The deception then had the 11th Division moving to Abergavenny in South Wales during October, 1944 when the deception was terminated by announcing that the 11th Division had been disbanded to provide replacements for other units. In the deception the 11th Infantry Division was composed of the notional 178th, 352nd, and 399th Infantry Regiments, in addition to notional artillery and support units.\n\"\"\"\n\nFrom the text given, extract the names of the individuals who commanded the 11th Division during the different time periods.

But the actor doesn't have any issue in the trend of revisiting the classic for a new spin.\n\nIt was with Falguni Pathak's song video that Bhatena walked into showbiz in 1999. In fact, Pathak has also objected to Kakkar's O Sajna version.\n\n\"A lot of people have been sending me DMs, and I have been getting a lot of messages where people are saying, 'How can Neha do this', 'she has spoiled the song', this and that, and all sorts of drama,\" Bhatena tells us.\n\nThe actor continues, \"The thing is that every person has one's own version of something.

{"prompt":"What is the definition of an IV infusion? How long do IV infusions take?","chosen":"An IV infusion is a medical procedure where a saline solution is injected into a vein through an intravenous catheter. This process is also referred to as intravenous infusion or simply IV. Intravenous infusion is often used to deliver medications, fluids, and nutrients to patients who are unable to take them by mouth or who need rapid administration of medications. Intravenous infusion can also be used to take blood samples and to monitor blood pressure and other vital signs.\n\nThe duration of an IV infusion depends on several factors, including the type of infusion, the patient's condition, and the purpose of the infusion. For example, an infusion for the treatment of dehydration may take only a few minutes, while an infusion for the treatment of cancer may take several hours. In general, IV infusions can take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.","rejected":"IV infusion is the process of infusing a liquid directly into the bloodstream via a vein using an IV line or catheter.

{"prompt":"Reference:\nScreaming Life is the debut EP by the American rock band Soundgarden, released in October 1987 through Sub Pop Records. Screaming Life was later combined with the band's next EP, Fopp (1988), and released as the Screaming Life\/Fopp compilation album in 1990.\n\nRecording\nThe EP was recorded in 1987 in Seattle, Washington, at Reciprocal Studios with producer Jack Endino, who also produced albums for Nirvana and Mudhoney.\n\nMusic and lyrics\nDrummer Matt Cameron described the sound on the EP as \"pretty raw\". \"Hunted Down\", Soundgarden's first single, is representative of the early \"grunge\" sound\u2014with its dirty guitar, dissonant atmosphere and lyrics concerning entrapment and escape. \"Nothing to Say\" features drop D tuning, which would become a signature of Soundgarden's sound on later albums. Guitarist Kim Thayil said he learned about the tuning from Buzz Osborne of the Melvins, when Osborne was telling him about Black Sabbath.\n\nEarlier versions of \"Tears to Forget\" appeared on the band's 1985 demo tape and on the 1986 Deep Six compilation album, which featured some of the first recordings by the earliest Seattle grunge bands, including Soundgarden. That version was recorded with drummer Scott Sundquist, but the version on Screaming Life was recorded with Cameron.\n\nSome time prior to recording, Endino found old rolls of quarter-inch tape at a garage sale, and some contained recordings of a Christian preacher giving sermons in the early 1950s. Soundgarden frontman Chris Cornell had the idea to have the preacher's voice on \"Hand of God\". The recording was synched with the eight-track machine, copied to an empty track and by coincidence (or because, as Endino says, \"God smiled upon us\") the tape rolls matched perfectly with the song. Cornell also added his own sarcastic preacher-style vocals, with the lines \"Let it be known today, if you've got two hands\/You're supposed to pray.\" According to Endino, the labels on the rolls of tape were near-illegible and thus the name of the preacher remains unknown.\n\nRelease and reception\nCornell said that the EP was met with rave reviews and that \"everybody loved it.\" \"Hunted Down\" was Soundgarden's first single and also the first song on Sub Pop's \"hold music\" tape. According to Thayil, \"you would call them up, and when they put you on hold you heard 'Hunted Down'.\" It was the only single released from the EP. \"Nothing to Say\" was Soundgarden's first B-side, released on the \"Hunted Down\" single. The song also appeared on the KCMU compilation tape, Bands That Will Make Money, which was distributed to record companies. Upon hearing the song, record labels began contacting the band, which eventually led to the band signing with A&amp;M Records.\n\nPackaging\nThe EP's cover art, photographed by Charles Peterson, features a sepia-toned black-and-white photograph of Cornell singing and Thayil playing guitar in the background. The album cover was an attempt by Sub Pop to capitalize on Cornell's image. The first 500\u00a0copies of the EP were pressed on transparent orange vinyl; after that, they were released on standard black vinyl. A second pressing was later made, pressed by Erika Records, but still on the Sub Pop label, in black, sea green marble, blue marble, red, pink marble and purple marble vinyl.\n\nThe title of the EP inspired the title of a book of photography by Peterson, named Screaming Life: A Chronicle of the Seattle Music Scene. Published in 1995, it is composed mainly of live photos taken by Peterson from the mid-1980s through the mid-1990s. Many of Peterson's photographs were used as album artwork for grunge bands. The book is accompanied by a CD, with nine songs selected by Peterson from bands of the era\u00a0\u2013 Soundgarden's \"Entering\" is one of these songs.\n\nTrack listing\n\nOuttakes\nThe song \"Toy Box\" was recorded during the sessions for Screaming Life. It was later featured on the \"Flower\" single.  The instrumental track \"The Telephantasm\" was recorded mostly during these sessions and was released as a separate single in late 2010 and as an iTunes bonus track on Telephantasm.\n\nPersonnel\nSoundgarden\nMatt Cameron \u2013  drums\nChris Cornell \u2013  vocals\nKim Thayil \u2013  guitar\nHiro Yamamoto \u2013  bass\n\nProduction\nJack Endino \u2013  production, engineering\nCharles Peterson \u2013  snapshots\nSoundgarden \u2013  production\n\nManagement\nSusan Silver Management \u2013 management\n\nInstruction:\nWhat was the early Seattle grunge scene like in the 1980s, and how did Soundgarden fit in?","chosen":"The early Seattle grunge scene in the 1980s was characterized by a vibrant and diverse music community, with many bands experimenting with different styles and sounds.

I would not have found this cracked jar if it werent for my loneliness, which sees gold in all that glitters. Inside the jar is the magic plant that Gilgamesh never stopped looking for. Ill show it to Tammuz when he comes, and well journey, as fast as light, to all the continents of the world, and all who smell it will be cured or freed, or will know its secret. I dont want Tammuz to come too late to hear my urgent song. 4.

He was the son of Augustine Webber, a well-known physician in Kentucky. His mother, who was the daughter of Gen. John Tannehill, passed on to him a fondness for outdoor life. In 1838, Webber went to Texas, then struggling for independence; was for several years connected with the famous Texas Rangers, seeing much of wild and adventurous life on the frontier; returned to Kentucky and studied medicine; afterward entered Princeton Theological Seminary with a view to the Presbyterian ministry, but abandoned that purpose, and settled in New York as a writer for literary periodicals, especially The New World, The Democratic Review, and The Sunday Despatch; was associate editor and joint proprietor of The Whig Review; planned, with the two sons of his friend John James Audubon the naturalist, a monthly magazine of mammoth size, to be illustrated with copper-plate colored engravings by Audubon, but published only the first number; was engaged in an unsuccessful attempt to lead an exploring and mining expedition to the region of the Colorado and Gila rivers in 1849.  A principal reason for the failure of the expedition to the west was the seizure of the horses by Comanche Indians.\n\nThe difficulty in crossing the western deserts led to his efforts to form a camel company, for which he obtained a charter from the New York legislature in 1854. In 1855 he went to Central America, where he joined the filibuster William Walker in Nicaragua and was killed in a skirmish.\n\nWorks\nIn addition to his contributions to periodicals, he authored of Old Hicks the Guide, or Adventures in the Comanche Country in Search of a Gold-Mine (New York, 1848); The Gold-Mines of the Gila (1849); The Hunter Naturalist, a Romance of Sporting (Philadelphia, 1851), with 40 engravings from original drawings by Mrs. Webber; Wild Scenes and Song-Birds (New York, 1854), with 20 colored illustrations from drawings by Mrs. Webber; Tales of the Southern Border (part i, 1852; complete, 1853); Spiritual Vampirism (1853); Jack Long; or The Shot in the Eye (a Gothic Western highly praised by Edgar Allan Poe); Adventures with the Texan Rifle Rangers (London, 1853); History of Mystery (Philadelphia, 1855); and other works.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nFrom the text, extract details about Webber's exploration attempts.

Consider the following:\n\nWhat are you learning Python for? For a university class, for a marketing role, or are you pursuing an entirely new data science career? Where is your starting point? Do you know Python fundamentals, or do you have zero programming experience? How much time can you devote to practice? One hour per day? 40 hours per week?\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a general answer, here it is:\nIf you just want to learn the Python basics, it may only take a few weeks. However, if you\u2019re pursuing a data science career from the beginning, you can expect it to take four to twelve months to learn enough advanced Python to be job ready.\n\nThe estimates above come from our students who have taken our Python fundamentals course, and those who have finished our Python career paths, which take someone with zero programming experience to job ready as quickly as possible using real-world code.\n\nThis article will answer some of the most common questions beginners ask about learning Python, like the following:\n- Is Python hard to learn?\n- Can you teach yourself Python?\n- Should you learn Python 2 or 3?\n- Why should one learn Python?\n- How can you learn Python faster?\n\nIs Learning Python Worth It in 2022?\nYes. From a career outlook, financial return, and versatility perspective, learning Python is certainly worth it. Python developers are in demand across a variety of industries.\n\nHowever, Python is particularly hot in the data science industry, where Python is used for everything from basic data analysis and visualization to creating advanced machine learning algorithms.\n\nIndeed.com's HiringLab investigated tech skills trends in 2020 and found demand for Python skills in data science was up 128% over the past five years, and it grew 12% over the course of 2019!\n\nLucrative Salaries\nCareers that require Python skills can earn salaries well over $100,000 per year in the United States. Here\u2019s a list of jobs requiring Python programming knowledge \u2014 and their U.S. salaries in August 2022:\nData analyst: $96,323\nData engineer: $117,917\nData scientist: $120,610\nPython developer: $113,938\nMachine learning engineer: $124,545\nSoftware engineer: $117,996\n\nIncredible Versatility\nThere's an inside joke in the Python community that Python is the second-best language for everything. Of course, what\u2019s best is subjective, but Python is incredibly flexible. It\u2019s the most commonly used language for data science (R is a close second), and it's also frequently used in a number of other industries.\n\nOne reason for its widespread popularity is that it\u2019s one of the easier languages to learn and use when working with data. And, fortunately for employers and data scientists alike, it doesn't require years of study to master.\n\nHow Long Does It Really Take to Learn Python?\nAs we mentioned before, the answer to this question depends on your goals. Python isn\u2019t just a programming language \u2014 it\u2019s a tool, and you learn how to use it in the context of the problems you're trying to solve.\n\nHere are some scenarios . . .\nA Marketer Who Wants a Slight Edge\nFor example, if you're a marketer who'd like to analyze Google Analytics data more rigorously, you could learn fundamental Python syntax and the required pandas techniques in a matter of weeks. This wouldn't make you a job-qualified Python developer or data analyst, but it would be enough to solve your problem.\n\nSeeking a New Data Science Career\nIf you're learning from the beginning and are looking for full-time work using Python, you can expect to spend at least a few months studying part-time. How many months will depend on the job you're looking for. Working through our Data Analyst in Python course path, for example, would get you ready to apply for jobs as a Data Analyst. Most learners take at least three months to complete this path.\n\nTo be clear, though, you could spend a lifetime learning Python. There are hundreds of libraries, many of them regularly improving and evolving, and the language itself also changes over time.\n\nIt doesn't take too long to become capable of solving problems with Python, but to master Python means continually learning and growing over the course of your career.\n\nCan You Teach Yourself Python?\nYes, it's very possible to learn Python on your own. There are many learning resources available on the web to help you learn Python for everything from web development to artificial intelligence.\n\nHere at Dataquest, we've helped thousands of students learn Python and get jobs in data science, all on their own schedule and from the comfort of their own homes.\n\nTeaching yourself Python does take time, though. You also have to be sure that you're writing code and applying what you learn in real-world scenarios, rather than just watching lecture videos and answering multiple-choice questions.\n\nTaking the right approach to learning Python can also be the difference between success or failure when you're learning through self-study.\n\nIs It Hard to Learn Python?\nNo, Python isn\u2019t hard to learn for most people. In fact, Python is considered one of the easiest programming languages to learn. While anyone can learn Python programming \u2014 even if you've never written a line of Python code before \u2014 you should expect that it will take time, and you should expect moments of frustration.\n\nDo I Need to be Good at Math to Learn Python?\nNo, you don\u2019t need to be good at Math to learn Python. While the conventional wisdom has long been that having natural talent for mathematics makes learning programming easier, a recent study suggests that's not the case.\n\nIn fact, if you've learned a foreign language, you might actually find it easier to learn Python than a \"math person\" would.\n\nWe've seen learners from a variety of backgrounds work through our courses and succeed, so don't let your own background stop you from giving Python a try!\n###\n\nWhat are some factors that affect the ease and time required to learn Python?

An offense is a crime or felony that is punishable according to the provisions of law. In a gathering, a person who is seen as ill-mannered and not showing courtesy is labeled as offensive.\n\nOffense is also a noun that describes the act of attacking the enemy as in team sports or even individual sports such as fencing, boxing, and MMA. In soccer or basketball, the team having possession of the ball and moving forward to the goal of the opposing team is said to be on the offensive.\n\nOffence is a word in British English, and hence it is used in all commonwealth countries. The origins of the word offense lie in French Offens, which is the word meaning misdeed. The French word is of course inspired by Latin Offensus which equates with annoyance in English. Being on the offence means being involved in the action or attacking the enemy. When you feel hurt or wounded by the action or words of someone else, you say you have been offended. If someone is not behaving like a gentleman and shows a general lack of politeness, he is said to be offensive.

This is a show we enjoyed when it came out as a movie and again when it was staged in Wellington, now the local opera society is putting it on at The Regent Theatre so we are going again and Kay and Neville are coming too. Yes I can count and I bought the four tickets we need two or three months ago.\n\nBut when I checked the tickets a couple of weeks before we go to the show, I find to my alarm that I only have three tickets. Feeling embarrassed I phone Neville and check that he did want to come to _Mama Mia_. He confirmed he is coming and I immediately hurry off to the Regent Theatre and buy another ticket in a seat as close to the others as is possible. Then I relaxed, until an hour later, when Neville phones back telling me not to buy the extra ticket, \"Remember in order to get a student concession I had to go to the theatre myself and show them my student card. So I've got my ticket with me here.\" The theatre never gives refunds but it doesn't matter, I'll give the extra ticket to Kay's husband Ross. So everything is fixed, and the number of tickets equals the number of people, which is what I always strive for. Again I relaxed.\n\nHowever then Kay phones to ask me to pick up the four tickets Serena Richdale has bought on line. She will get them the day of the show, which coincidently is Aidan Murphy's birthday. I decide it is safest if I keep Serena's tickets at our house.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nGiven that self-concept and autobiographical memory are both culturally constructed from an early age, they may be linked not only at the cultural level but at the individual level as well. Thus, individuals with a greater autonomous sense of self should have more detailed, specific, and self-focused autobiographical memories. Consistent with this reasoning, our studies show that regardless of culture, children and adults who dwell more on personal attributes and qualities when describing themselves are more likely to provide detailed, specific, and self-focused memories, compared with those who dwell more on social roles and group memberships. In a more recent study, it was found that a focus on personal aspects of self in 3-year-olds uniquely predicted the amount of event details they recalled, independent of culture, gender, and language skills. \n\nSelf-concept and autobiographical memory may further correspond across an individual\u2019s life periods. Theorists contend that individuals, no matter where they live, develop both personal (self-perceived distinctiveness) and social (self-perceived connectedness) identities in response to basic human needs and universal societal expectations. The increasing autonomy and relatedness during ontogeny, then, should be reflected in individuals\u2019 lifespan retrieval. That is, when asked to recall personal experiences from their lives, individuals should exhibit an increase in both personal and social\nfocuses on memories from earlier to later life periods. This prediction was confirmed in our study with Euro-American and Chinese middle-aged adults. Compared\nwith participants\u2019 reported memories from childhood and youth, their memories from midlife periods were more likely to be specific episodes, focused more on the preferences and perspectives of the remembered; midlife memories also attended more to social groups and significant others, independent of memory length. Thus, autobiographical remembering appears to be in concert with the lifespan development of personal and social identities.\n\nIf individuals possess both personal and social-relational aspects of self, it should be possible to prompt them to focus temporarily on either. We found that such shifts in attention can affect the content and accessibility of early memories. We asked European and Asian American adults to describe themselves by listing either ten unique personal attributes (personal prime) or ten memberships in social groups (relational prime). We then asked them to recall their earliest childhood memory. Regardless of culture, the personal prime elicited memories that focused more on the rememberer and less on social interactions than did the relational prime. The personal prime also helped Asians access more distant childhood memories, such that the first memories they reported were as early as those of Euro-Americans.\n\nSo, the focuses on autonomy and relatedness in self-views vary across individuals; they both increase within an individual with development; and they can change temporarily across circumstances, which further shape the content, style, and accessibility\nof autobiographical memories. These individual cognitive processes may elucidate how cultural differences in self-knowledge are formed and sustained: People incorporate into their self-concepts differing cultural views about the self that facilitate culture-specific forms of autobiographical remembering (i.e., which memories and which aspects of the memories are most likely to be accessible and enduring); their memories, in turn, support and regulate different modes of self-concept endorsed by their cultures.\n###\nHow does the passage highlight the impact of technological advancements on the evolution of human communication?

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen the viewpoint character to center your first-person narrative, it\u2019s time to plot out the beginning of your story. First-person narratives have a specific set of objectives that most writers try to fulfill in order to establish a specific voice and narrative tone early in the story. Here are some writing tips for how to begin your first-person story: Establish a clear voice. Your narrator\u2019s voice should be clear and consistent, especially at the beginning of the story. If you have a distinctive, strong voice through which your story is being filtered, your readers will have an immediate understanding of how your narrator operates. The narrative voice takes your readers inside your character\u2019s head and shows how they view the world.\nStart mid-action. Stories told in a first-person voice often start in the middle of the action. One of the advantages of first-person narration is cutting out some of the distance between your readers and the action of your story. If you start in the middle of the action, readers will get an appreciation for your narrator\u2019s voice and see events through your character\u2019s eyes.\nIntroduce supporting characters early. Begin introducing different characters early on in your narrative. If your main character is the narrator of your story, having them introduce other characters is a great way of setting up your premise and showing your protagonist\u2019s relationship to the other characters in the story. You may even consider making a secondary character your narrator; just because you are writing from the first-person point of view doesn\u2019t mean you need to make your protagonist the narrator. If you think about the Sherlock Holmes stories, most of them are told from the point of view of Holmes\u2019s partner, Watson. Filtering a story through a secondary character\u2019s eyes can be a great way of providing perspective on your protagonist. Use the active voice. If you opt for first-person narration as opposed to second-person or third-person POV, remember to keep your voice active and steer clear of passive voice. Establishing an active voice early in your narrative will hook your readers and make your prose more engaging. Decide if your narrator is reliable. When writing a first-person story, you always have the option of using an unreliable narrator. In stories with a third-person narrator, we usually assume that information relayed to us is factually true (although there is some discrepancy in reliability between third-person limited POV and third-person omniscient POV). A first-person POV provides us with our narrator\u2019s experience. You must decide whether the character narrating has an accurate view of the world around them and how much you want your audience to view the narration as accurate or skewed. Decide on a tense for your opening. A first-person narrative can jump around between present tense and past tense just like any other story, but it\u2019s useful to consider which tense best serves the opening of your story. Is your story a reflection on events past or a blow-by-blow account of present action? Decide on what tense you want to use in your first paragraph and chapter to set a frame of reference for your readers.\nStudy first-person opening lines in literature. One way to better understand how to establish a first-person narrator at the beginning of a story is to study the opening sentences of famous novels and short stories written from a first-person perspective. The first sentence is a key element of every story, and it has to serve a variety of unique purposes in a first-person narrative. The first line should relay a character\u2019s thoughts and clearly establish the character\u2019s voice in addition to launching us into the main storyline. Some iconic examples of novels that begin in first-person POV are Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Moby Dick by Herman Melville, The Hound of the Baskervilles by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Catcher in the Rye by J. D. Salinger, and To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee.\n\nYour task is to:\nI am writing a first person narrative story and need some tips.

It is currently a department within the Government of Gibraltar.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Gibraltar Post Office has been running for over 150 years, as in 1857 the Overland Post Office (based in the colonial authorities' premises at Secretary's Lane) merged with the Packet Agency (which had office's in Turnbull's Lane). The first stamps went on sale in September and a year later a new building was completed and opened at 104 Main Street. This remains the main post office in Gibraltar today.\n\nIn 1886 the local colonial authorities took over control of the Gibraltar Post Office and were able to issue their own stamps. Initially they overprinted Bermuda stamps but by December they had their own design. However, they still sold Spanish stamps if required and between 1889 and 1898 the post office sold Gibraltar stamps valued in pesetas as this was the currency in circulation.\n\nFor the first fifty years, the Gibraltar Post Office had responsibility for the post office not only in Gibraltar but also for the British postal service in Morocco. This ended in 1907.\n\nIn 2005 the Gibraltar Post Office was granted the title of \"Royal\" by Her Majesty the Queen. Gibraltar is the only Commonwealth or British Overseas Territory post office outside the United Kingdom that bears this title. Gibraltar has traditional red pillar boxes and the tops are also frequently painted black.\n\nThe Post Office continues to provide some traditional services and was still using benefit books after they were abandoned in the United Kingdom, while there is also a special philatelic counter to sell the commemorative stamps.\n\nThe Post office provides a next day delivery service to the community with letters posted before 07.00 that day in any of the 30+ pillar boxes located in Gibraltar delivered same day.

{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nThe Preetz Model 65 is a blowback action, semi-automatic .22LR caliber survival rifle made in several models by Josef G. Landmann of Holstein or Preetz, West Germany, also listed as J.G.L. or JGL 65, 68 and 69 in some references. It was intended as a rival to the Armalite AR-7. A .22 Magnum version identified by a tubular extension to the receiver was also made. An article on Guns.com has suggested that the Model 65 is actually a clone of the AR-7. This claim is supported by allegations on some firearms forums that with a little work, many of the internal parts are interchangeable between the two.\n\nOverview\nThe JGL Preetz Automat Model 65 was manufactured in West Germany. The receiver is made of zamac, a zinc-aluminum alloy. Like the AR-7, the barrel is retained by a hand tightened nut and is removable. Unlike the AR-7, it has a flat sided receiver and it was not intended to disassemble to pack into its own buttstock. It was offered in different barrel lengths with various handguards, stocks and pistol grips. It was offered in a conventional sporting rifle version and in variations that replicated the appearance of military arms such as the C96 Broomhandle Mauser, M1 Carbine and M1A1 Thompson submachine gun.\nBased on completed auction listings showing serial numbers, total production was in excess of 39,000 Model 65s of all types. There was a brief interruption in production in 1970 because of a West German law (later repealed) forbidding the production of civilian firearms that resembled military guns following the usage by the left-wing militant group Red Army Faction.\n\nUse Outside West Germany\n\nAustralia\nThe Model 65 has been banned for sale or ownership in Australia for two reasons. First, because it can be configured to resemble a Thompson submachine gun, which is banned under Australian law. Second, because it has been said its action can be modified to fire in full automatic mode.\n\nCanada\nSome Model 65s were imported to Canada as light sporting rifles in the late 1960s.\n\nNorthern Ireland\nIt has been alleged that during The Troubles, the Irish Republican Army modified these carbines so they would fire full-auto.\n\nPhilippines\nThe Philippines Constabulary is said to have purchased a quantity of Model 65s for use by its officers in the late 1960s.\n\"\"\"\nWhat is the history and use of the Preetz Model 65 outside of West Germany?","chosen":"The Preetz Model 65 is a blowback action, semi-automatic .22LR caliber survival rifle that was intended as a rival to the Armalite AR-7.

They came as far as the knees without resistance, but partway up the thigh, things got tight in a hurry. Nicole had to work to get them all the way up her legs\u2014getting them over her hips to her waist was nearly impossible. \"Oh, wow,\" she gasped. It felt as if she were wearing a girdle, and the pants weren't even buttoned yet. Nicole eyed the V-shaped expanse of white belly showing through the gap of her open fly and felt herself beginning to panic. There was no way those pants were closing. Not today. Not next week. Not the week after that . . .\n\n\"Stop it!\" she said out loud, taking a deep breath. The contest was still four weeks away. That gave her plenty of time to diet. She'd just have to be smart about this\u2014she'd have to stop eating completely.\n\n_Because you have to win this contest,_ she thought. She'd known that almost from the moment she'd first seen the poster. She _had_ to win, because this was her chance to fix everything. When she was a famous model, her entire life would change for the better: her stupid little sister would show her some respect, her parents would have to give her more freedom and let her see the world, and at school she'd finally be popular. Not a little bit, oh-yeah-I-know-who-she-is popular, the way she was now. _Mega_ popular. Melanie Andrews popular.\n\nBut the best thing of all would be the chance to laugh in Jesse Jones's face. How she ached to pay him back for the way he'd treated her! How she'd love to saunter by him in the quad with an adoring guy on either side of her and a whole smitten squad following along behind. _Cute_ guys . . . no, _college_ guys . . . no, _fellow models_! Wouldn't that just serve him right?\n\nNicole smiled at the image. When she got famous, she was going to pretend she didn't even know who Jesse Jones was.\n\n____\n\n\"Okay, then.

Peter nodded and drove off.\n\n_He sure is acting strange lately,_ Jenna thought, watching him go. _Almost as if I make him nervous or something._ All afternoon, while the two of them worked on homework in his den, he'd been jumpy and distracted. Jenna had asked him a question about geometry and he'd nearly knocked over his soda. She'd never seen him that way before, and she didn't think she liked it.\n\nThe Conrads' front door flew open, startling her out of her trance. \"Jenna!

She'd gotten home a little late, but she still wanted to put her things in her room and wash up before everyone sat down.\n\n\"Thanks, squirt,\" she said as she shot by her sister and up the staircase. With seven people in the house to plan meals around, Mrs. Conrad didn't take kindly to anyone coming to the table late. Jenna knew she'd have to hurry.\n\nShe reached the top of the stairs, flung her door open, and froze. Her chest clenched so tightly with anger that for a moment she couldn't breathe. Maggie's stupid Clue posters were all exactly as Jenna had left them, but the little weasel had taken down her sheets! Every single pushpin had been pulled from the ceiling, and they weren't back in her bulletin board either. They were gone, like the sheets. Vanished without a trace.\n\n\"Oh, this really tears it!\" Jenna exclaimed, forgetting that she'd wanted to wash up for dinner, forgetting everything except getting even with Maggie. \"I don't have to put up with this!\" She dropped her backpack, turned, and raced down the stairs, bursting into the dining room just as the rest of her family was gathering to eat.\n\n\"Don't let us keep you waiting,\" her father teased as she slid ungracefully into her usual seat.\n\nJenna bit her lip while she waited for her parents, Caitlin, Maggie, Allison, and Sarah to be seated. She had every intention of calling Maggie's bluff within the next five minutes, but she knew better than to do it before grace. Everyone bowed their heads.\n\n\"Dear Lord, for the food on this table, we thank you,\" Mr. Conrad began, reciting the prayer his father had taught him as a boy. \"For the people in this room, we thank you.

It closed in April 1963 and reopened three blocks north in 1964, at 82 University Place, between 11th and 12th Streets.\n\nHistory\n\n1860s-1950s \nThe Cedar Tavern was opened in 1866 on Cedar Street, near present day Zuccotti Park. In 1933 it moved north to 55 West Eighth Street. In 1945 it moved east to 24 University Place. In 1955, the Cedar Tavern was purchased by Sam Diliberto, a butcher, and his brother in law, John Bodnar, a window washer, from Joe Provenzano.\n\n1950s \nRobert Motherwell had a studio nearby in the early 1950s, and he held a weekly salon for artists there. The Cedar was the closest place for them to have a drink afterwards.  Habitu\u00e9s liked it for its cheap drinks and lack of tourists or middle-class squares. University Place in those days was downmarket because of the several welfare and single-room occupancy hotels in the area. Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko, Franz Kline, Michael Goldberg, Landes Lewitin, Aristodimos Kaldis, Phillip Guston, Knute Stiles, Ted Joans, James Brooks, Charles Cajori, Mercedes Matter, Howard Kanovitz, Al Leslie, Stanley Twardowicz, Morton Feldman, John Cage, and others of the New York School all patronized the bar in the 1950s when many lived in or near Greenwich Village. Historians consider it an important incubator of the Abstract Expressionist movement. It was also popular with writers Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, Gregory Corso, Frank O'Hara, George Plimpton, Jean Stein, Harold \"Doc\" Humes, Alex Trocchi, and LeRoi Jones Pollock was eventually banned from the establishment for tearing the bathroom door off its hinges and hurling it across the room at Franz Kline, as was Kerouac, who allegedly urinated in an ashtray.\n\n1960s \nSam and John looked to the East Village around St. Mark's Pl. to reopen after the building was sold and demolished in 1963. After a year they bought the building at 82 University Place, which had been occupied by an antique store, and built the new bar in a more upscale pub style. By this time Pollock and Kline were gone, de Kooning had moved to East Hampton, and the scene gradually dissipated.\n\nIn the 1960s, Tuli Kupferberg of The Fugs, David Amram, and occasionally Bob Dylan, were known to patronize the Cedar Tavern. D.A. Pennebaker, Dylan, and Bob Neuwirth met there to plan the shooting of their 1967 documentary, Dont Look Back.\n\n2000s \nDiliberto's sons Mike and Joe ran the place successfully for many years until 2006, when they decided to develop the site into condominiums. In December 2006, the Cedar Tavern closed to allow for the construction of a seven-story addition to the building in which it is housed. Its owners had pledged to reopen in six months, but an opinion piece in the December 3, 2006 edition of The New York Times speculated that it was closed for good. This proved prescient; in the wake of Joe Diliberto's death on October 27, 2007, his brother Mike failed to reopen the establishment.\n\nWhen the Cedar Tavern closed in 2006, its century-old, 50 foot mahogany bar was sold to Austin businessmen, John M. Scott and Eddy Patterson. The bar was taken apart into hundreds of pieces, transported by movers of fine art, and stored for ten years. In 2016, it was brought out of storage to serve as the centerpiece of Eberly, a restaurant in Austin, Texas.  \n\nThe 24 University Place site, where most of the significant events in the establishment's history occurred, is now a full-block residential building; the primary ground-floor retail space of the building's University Place frontage is occupied by a CVS Pharmacy.\n\nArtist photos \n(Selection was limited by availability.)\n\nLiterary and TV depictions\n(Selection was limited by availability.)\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nHow did the Cedar Tavern shape the art and literary communities of Greenwich Village in the mid-20th century?","chosen":"The Cedar Tavern was a gathering place for avant garde artists and writers in the mid-20th century.

{"prompt":"Consider this reference information delimited in \"\"\":\n\"\"\"\nI would guess even the most brilliant, experienced, educated-about-teens parent has felt the same sentiments as you about their teenager's behavior: \"I don't know why or what to do.\" Although research suggests that a majority of adolescents are not the reckless, rude nightmares of stereotypes, most still have their mystifying moments.\n\nThe reasons for your daughter's attitude might be complex and personal to her, and impossible to understand without meeting and talking to her. However, some simple explanations that could apply to many teens at this age might be helpful to consider.\n\nThere's a lot going on for teenagers. Their emotions can feel like a rollercoaster, and they're clambering toward independence. Since you are their safe person, they may feel safest lashing out at you.\n\nYour emotions live in your brain's limbic system, where they light up when you feel them\u2014pleasant or unpleasant. Studies have shown that for adolescents, this limbic system affected by puberty hormonal changes results in increased emotional outbursts and impulsivity.  Imagine your annoyance when someone asks you to do something you don't want to do and triple it in your teen's brain.\n\nAdults have the impulse control to manage or lower intensity annoyance by holding back so they can respond respectfully. This can take double the effort for teenagers, whose brains are still developing and maturing. Picture your teen's brain lighting up with fireworks of frustration as they react in a way that appears to be completely out of proportion to the source. This image might at least help you keep your cool when your teen can't.\n\nAnother formative part of adolescent development is testing limits. It's not a conscious, \"What happens if I let my emotions fly when my mom asks me to clean up?\" but rather a learned association: When I flip out because I don't want to help around the house, mom backs off and I don't have to do it.\n\nThe limits can be emotional as well: Your teen may not know where or how else to unleash all this intense emotion, so they fling it at you. If nothing too terrible happens, this can become a pattern that feels easier to them than the hard work of regulating these intense emotions on their own.\n\nIt is well known that children behave differently with their parents. Sometimes that means they save their worst tantrums for when you are alone with them or fall apart at home after a day of holding it together at school. That's because they know (hopefully) you love them no matter how they act.\n\nIn the bestselling book about raising teenage girls, Untangled, Lisa Damour, Ph.D. presents the upside of an argumentative teen: They feel safe speaking up and fighting for their perspective. Dr. Damour suggests that highly obedient teens can be more likely to rebel in a secretive way that can pose more risk.\n\nIf your teen openly debates and argues with you, it means they trust they can do so without losing your love and support. So, ironically, if you have a teen \"with attitude,\" it might be a sign they are developing their independence within a trusting relationship with you.\n\nAll of these understandable reasons for teenagers acting out don't give them full reign to behave and treat you however they want just because you love them unconditionally. You can have empathy for their emotions while placing boundaries around their behaviors.\n\nTeens are often compared to toddlers in terms of the primal nature of their emotions. Although adolescents obviously have a lot more skills than toddlers, their emotions can feel just as out of control. As their brains change, along with the demands of their environments from the social to the academic, they need to develop more sophisticated self-regulation strategies than what worked at younger ages.\n\nConnect with your teen during a calm, peaceful moment to identify the problem (\"lashing out\"), its natural consequences (high stress and conflict between you), and possible replacements for lashing out (emotion regulation strategies). It helps to name what would motivate them to change, such as less arguing.\n\nIt might help to make a visual list of emotional regulation strategies to help get into the habit of using them. \nCommon strategies include:\n\n-Going for a walk or run.\n-Listening to music.\n-Writing in a journal.\n-Drawing.\n-Connecting with a friend.\n\nIf teens can learn ways to calm themselves in the moment, they can better do the next critical step: Discuss their stress and emotions directly with you rather than taking them out on you.\n\nWithin all of this support for their emotions, maintain your behavioral expectations. Helping around the house and responding to you respectfully even if in disagreement should still be expected.\n\nThere can be a wide range of teenage behavior that fits on the continuum of \"normal,\" no matter how aggravating. However, you may want to get your teen a psychological evaluation if you notice the following:\n\n-Irritability dominates your teen's mood.\n-They seem to have difficulty enjoying activities.\n-You notice other significant changes in sleep, appetite, or behaviors.\n\nA mental health professional with expertise in adolescents can do an assessment to ensure a mental health condition like depression or anxiety is not underlying what you are observing. If your teen is experiencing symptoms at the level of a mental health diagnosis, the sooner they get help, the better.\n\"\"\"\n\nWho is the intended audience for this article?

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\nThe Aloe vera plant has been used for thousands of years to heal a variety of conditions, most notably burns, wounds, skin irritations, and constipation. It is grown in subtropical and tropical locations, including South Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Aloe was one of the most frequently prescribed medicines throughout most of the 18th and 19th centuries and it remains one of the most commonly used herbs in the United States today. However, oral use of aloe for constipation is no longer recommended, as it can have severe side effects.\n\nAloe gel, made from the central part of the aloe leaf, is a common household remedy for minor cuts and burns, as well as sunburns. It can be found in many commercial skin lotions and cosmetics. Aloe contains active compounds that may reduce pain and inflammation and stimulate skin growth and repair. It is also an effective moisturizing agent. For this reason, aloe vera gel has gained tremendous popularity for the relief of burns. In one study, burn sites treated with aloe healed completely in less than 16 days compared to 19 days for sites treated with silver sulfadiazine. In a review of the scientific literature, researchers found that patients who were treated with aloe vera healed an average of almost 9 days sooner than those who were not treated with the medicinal plant. However, other studies show mixed results. At least one study found that aloe actually delayed healing. Aloe is best used for minor burns and skin irritations and should never be applied to an open wound.\n\nAlthough aloe is 99 percent water, aloe gel also contains substances known as glycoproteins and polysaccharides. Glycoproteins speed the healing process by stopping pain and inflammation while polysaccharides stimulate skin growth and repair.

{"prompt":"What is the difference between a station wagon and a SUV?","chosen":"A station wagon and a SUV are both types of vehicles that are commonly used for family transportation, but they have some distinct differences.\n\nA station wagon is typically a longer, more streamlined car that is designed for cargo and passenger space. They often have a boot (trunk) at the back that is large enough to store luggage or other items, and some models have folding seats that can increase the available space. Station wagons are often used for long road trips or for families with children.\n\nOn the other hand, a SUV (sport utility vehicle) is a larger, more rugged vehicle that is designed for both on-road and off-road use. SUVs often have four-wheel drive and a higher ground clearance than other types of vehicles, making them more capable of handling rough terrain. SUVs are often used for outdoor activities such as camping or hunting, but they are also popular for family transportation due to their spacious interior and safety features.\n\nIn summary, the main difference between a station wagon and a SUV is their design and intended use.

{"prompt":"Reference:\nIn the Jerusalem Talmud, \"minyan\" is defined as nine Jewish men and a Torah scroll present. The Babylonian Talmud, on the other hand, dictates that nine Jewish men and the Ark join together to form \"minyan.\" Still other combinations are suggested for different situations.\n\n_The illustrious twelfth-century French authority Rabbenyu Tam, grandson of Rashi, commented on the apparently popular practice of counting a minor as part of a 'minyan' if the boy held a chumash (Pentateuch) in his hand. 13_\n\nIn a large city like Jerusalem, \"minyan\" would certainly be 10 Jewish men. In some of the very small villages and hamlets, like Nazareth, \"minyan\" might be as few as six.\n\nImagine the shock and surprise when Jesus said:\n\nAgain, I tell you that if two of you on earth agree about anything you ask for, it will be done for you by my father in heaven. For where two or three come together in my name, there am I with them. Matthew 18:19, 20\n\nThis quotation raises some questions. If God, in Jesus Christ, is omnipresent, then why does Jesus use the stipulation \"where two or three are gathered together\" when He is everywhere present all the time? God, in Jesus Christ, is omnipresent. Jesus was not speaking so much in terms of theology as He was of worship. He was not saying He would stay away until at least two have come together. He was saying, \"My presence is not legalistically determined by number, but by relationships.\" We will say more about this later.\n\nJesus spoke quite specifically. Why did He choose the numbers two or three? Why didn't he choose one? Or four?\n\nThere is no fellowship involved with a single person. There is also no verification. It is not coincidental that Deuteronomy speaks in this manner:\n\nOn the testimony of two or three witnesses a man shall be put to death, but no one shall be put to death on the testimony of one witness. Deuteronomy 17:6\n\nThis passage establishes two or three witnesses as verification for truth. Jesus was establishing \"minyan\" for those who were His disciples. Jesus was not finding fault with Jewish \"minyan.\" He was defining a worship relationship with God for His followers. Two is enough to establish a level of fellowship among Christian people. It is few enough to foster the idea of personal worship.\n\nKeep in mind that Jesus' announcement in Matthew 18:20 is part of the paragraph of Matthew 18:15-20. The subject of that paragraph describes how to deal with a Christian brother who sins. A situation of fellowship is established when you and the erring Christian brother come together. You need no one else.

Why would they be screaming like that?\"\n\n\"How you know he's _dead_?\" John Lee asked.\n\nWhat?\n\nThe ignorance of the question was almost shocking, and Connie looked around at the others, hoping that they, too, would agree. But before he made eye contact with even one of them, he realized that he didn't know for sure that the man was dead. How could he? He was just a guy who watched a lot of crime shows and read a lot of murder mysteries, and suddenly he remembered several where the dead body was suddenly not dead.

Madison checked her watch. \"Alright, guys and gals we have three hours until dinner. That gives us plenty of time to take a tour of our wonderful camp here.\" She raised her hands and motioned forward. \"Follow me.\"\n\nThey all walked back to the main camp area, where she pointed out the office and directors' sleeping accommodations. Next to it was the hall \/gym. She explained in there they held movies and if it rained indoor activities. She also told them about the dance they had midway through camp. The infirmary was walked by and Madison informed everyone that if they had medications it was to be turned in there.\n\nFinally, the mess hall. \"Each week a team gets duties. Lucky, we don't have kitchen duty until next week. However, we have the wonderful bathrooms.\" Several eew's and gross' were heard.\n\nBetween the infirmary and the mess hall the bathrooms, a basketball court and volleyball pit could be seen. Beyond them were more cabins, then a small field. They all made their way over to the stables. Madison hopped up on the corral fence. \"This is Mr. Masters thing, so I'll let him explain.\"\n\nRafe went over some of the basic things he would be teaching them. The whole time Madison listened to the soft-spoken tone of his voice. It sent chills up her spine. Rafe had great eye contact with the kids. Each time he caught her look he would flash his dazzling smile at Madison.\n\nAt the Archery range, Madison showed off her bow skills in a demonstration of what they would learn. \"My dad can shoot.\" Henry blurted out.\n\n\"Really? Maybe he'd like to take a shot then.\" Madison handed Rafe her bow.\n\nHe tried to decline, but Madison gave him a challenging look. Daring him. To be honest she was curious to see what he could do. Rafe took his stance and aimed. Several slow breaths then he released on the exhale. Bull's-eye! Right on the mark.\n\nMadison clapped. \"Nice, very impressive.\" Rafe handed the bow back then took a bow. \"Ok, who's hungry?\" Twenty kids screamed.\n\n\"The last one to the mess hall gets to mop the floor of my cabin.\" She started running towards the camp square, a pack of hungry wolves on her tail. Rafe bringing up the rear.\n\nAll through dinner Madison never once said anything that he was the one that would be mopping the floors of her cabin. She observed Rafe from her end of the long table. Brief eye contact was shared but each time she was the one to turn away. There was something about him that made her uncomfortable, what though she couldn't put her finger on.\n\nWhen they were in front of the fire pit, Madison spun around on her heels. Rafe almost walked into her. \"Whoa.\"\n\n\"Ahh...Mr. Masters. So, you ready to mop?\" She wore a wicked grin\n\n\"What?\" He was confused.\n\n\"You were the last wolf to the mess hall, so you get to mop.\" All the kids laughed.\n\n\"I...umm...fine, but just remember I'll get you back.\"\n\n\"I wouldn't do that if I were you!\" Megan jumped in.\n\n\"Do what?\" Rafe put his hands on his hips.\n\n\"Challenge mom, you'll lose I promise.\" She smiled \"You see every year at least one counselor gets practical jokes done on them and no one has been able to get her.\"\n\n\"Is that so?\" Slowly a wicked expression formed on Rafe's face...\n\nHe walked up to Madison and whispered in her ear. \"Paybacks a bitch, hon.\" Then went into his cabin.\n\n\"And I'm the Queen Bee!\" Madison shot back.\n\nEveryone went inside. Madison gave a rundown of all the next days' events after Rafe mopped the cabin. They would be getting their first lessons. In the middle of her discussion, Madison was distracted by noises outside the window. Peeking outside she saw Rafe and the boys around a roaring fire. It seemed Rafe was telling stories about one of his films and swinging a stick like a sword.\n\nThe girls went to the window on the south side and peered out. \"My costar and I were right in the middle of them, fighting for our lives...\"\n\nMadison turned to the girls with a finger to her lips. \"SSSSh.\" Quietly she pulled her re-curve bow off the wall and crept out behind Rafe. He was so into his story that he didn't hear her pull back the eighty-five-pound drawstring. Putting the arrow tip to the side of his neck, she said: \"Awww the big hunter caught in a trap?.\"\n\nRafe froze for a second then turned his head to see the tip of a double-bladed arrow pointed at him. The girls all snickered from the windows then ran out.\n\n\"That's two I owe you.\" He held up two fingers.\n\n\"HA!\" Madison threw her head back as she lowered the bow. It had started a battle of wits. Rafe would be relentless at his revenge on this woman.\n\nAfter the kids had gone to bed Madison went out and sat by the fire that was down to glowing embers. She was on the grass leaning back on her elbows gazing up at the canopy of stars.

Previously, it was probably called , which in translation means 'small'. In pre-revolutionary sources it is also mentioned under the name 'Vershina rechki Marasa' (the top of the Marasa river).\n\nHistory \nAccording to old residents, the village of Kichkalnya was formed at the beginning of the 18th century. From stories passed down from generation to generation, the village was founded by three families who came from the Chuvash village of Uzeevo (now Aksubayevsky District). Mullah Tohvatullah was among the first founders of the village. According to legend, these families fled from their homes, hiding from forced baptism after the conquest the Khanate of Kazan by Ivan the Terrible. In fact, the resettlement of several families from the village of Uzeevo is explained by intraregional resettlement, since Ivan the Terrible died back in 1584.\n\nThe existing historiographic literature provides contradictory information about the date of the village formation - from the mid-1650s to 1710. According to the legend, a certain name in 1911 claimed that the village \"Morasa Bashy\" was founded 300 years ago, that is, in 1611, but this is highly unlikely.\nUntil 1920, it was part of the Staro-Almetevskaya Volost of the Chistopol Uyezd of the Kazan Governorate.\n\nAt 18th - 1st half of 19th centuries residents belonged to the category of state peasants, performed lashman duty.

This information can be used to trigger automated systems, such as train and elevator brakes, and to send out warnings to people in the affected area through apps, text messages, and other channels. The early warning gives people time to take protective actions, such as dropping, covering, and holding on, which can reduce the risk of injury during an earthquake.","rejected":"Earthquake early warning systems like ShakeAlert use sensors to detect the start of an earthquake, and then use algorithms to estimate the size and location of the earthquake. When an earthquake is detected, the system sends out alerts to users with information about the size and location of the earthquake, and potentially how much shaking is expected at their location. This can give people a few seconds or minutes of warning before the shaking starts, which can help them take cover or evacuate if necessary."}
{"prompt":"Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nIntroduction\n\nA struggle is underway in Washington over the production of electric vehicles (EVs) and the tax credits offered to American consumers under the landmark Inflation Reduction Act. This debate has significant implications for Canada and the global market. While some argue for a rapid transition to a low-carbon economy, others emphasize the need for re-industrialization and reduced reliance on China. This article explores the ongoing clash and its potential consequences.\n\nThe Importance of EV Tax Credits\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act provides tax credits worth up to $7,500 per car to incentivize the purchase of EVs. The U.S. Treasury Department is currently designing the rules for implementing this law, which is considered a major legislative achievement of the Biden administration. The main question at the center of the debate is whether the goal is to sell more EVs quickly or to achieve a slower re-industrialization of North America.\n\nEnvironmental and Practical Arguments\n\nAdvocates for an expansive interpretation of the law argue that meeting climate goals requires a rapid electrification of the vehicle fleet. They claim that overly protectionist rules would hinder progress by disqualifying most cars from tax credits. These proponents emphasize the need to reduce dependence on China for critical minerals and industrial inputs that power Western economies.\n\nNational Security Concerns\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of a broad interpretation of the law raise concerns about national security. They argue that Western countries are overly reliant on China for industrial inputs, which poses risks to their economies. The U.S. domestic mining lobby warns that China currently controls 70% of the battery supply chain and that this trend needs to be reversed. They argue for stricter regulations to support domestic sourcing and reduce reliance on unreliable countries.\n\nCanadian Stakeholders\u2019 Perspectives\n\nCanadian stakeholders have also weighed in on the debate. Previously, Canada expressed concerns about being shut out of the tax credits entirely. However, now some Canadian companies and the Quebec government are urging regulators to adopt stricter rules. Nano One Materials Corp., a Canadian battery-technology manufacturer, argues that the draft regulations are too broad and fail to protect critical minerals like iron. They fear that the tax credits will end up subsidizing batteries mostly produced in China, undermining Canada\u2019s efforts to reduce dependency on its rival.\n\nA Generational Opportunity for Canada\n\nNano One CEO Dan Blondal sees the Inflation Reduction Act as a rare chance for Canada to ease its dependency on China. He believes that failing to do so would have negative implications for national security, job creation, and environmental goals. Quebec also argues that the current rules risk further entrenching U.S. dependency on unreliable countries with state-funded companies, indirectly referring to China.\n\nThe Call for a Strict Interpretation\n\nThe U.S. senator who provided the critical swing vote for passing the law, Sen. Joe Manchin, has called for a strict interpretation of the legislation. He argues that the Biden administration has deviated from the original intention of the law in several aspects. Manchin emphasizes the need to follow the law and ensure that tax credits are not granted to batteries that do not meet the intended conditions.\n\nThe Climate Counter-Argument\n\nAdvocates for a more generous application of tax credits emphasize the urgent threat of climate change. They argue that looser rules are necessary to achieve the goal of EVs accounting for two-thirds of light vehicles sold in the U.S. by 2032. Private-sector forecasts suggest that the U.S. may fall slightly short of this target without sufficient incentives.\n\nImplications for Canada and the Global Market\n\nThe final rules for implementing the Inflation Reduction Act will have significant implications for Canada and the global market. The decision on which products qualify for tax credits will impact the competitiveness of Canadian companies and their ability to access the U.S. market. Additionally, the upcoming rule that forbids tax credits for batteries produced by foreign entities of concern raises uncertainty for carmakers, including those in the U.S. partnering with Chinese suppliers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe battle over EV tax credits in the U.S. has far-reaching implications for Canada and the global market. The debate revolves around the balance between promoting EV adoption and reducing reliance on China for critical minerals and industrial inputs.

If you\u2019re a \u201990s kid, you either owned one yourself or spent every recess looking over the shoulder of someone who did. But while the toy has pretty much disappeared from schoolyards these days\u2014replaced by smartphones\u2014many of its key features had a significant impact on the video game industry and live on in major games today.\n\nThe Tamagotchi, which was first released by Bandai in Japan on November 23, 1996, had only a 32x16 pixel screen and three small buttons. Each of these buttons served some simple function, like feeding your Tamagotchi (which was both the name of the device and the little creature you were tasked with taking care of), turning off the lights in its room, or playing a game with it. Functions also included cleaning up your Tamagotchi\u2019s poop\u2014at times so frequently that you could not help but worry about the health of its colon.\n\nFail at these simple tasks and your Tamagotchi suffers a gruesome, neglectful death. After a bunch of ear-piercing beeps and a little wiggle, the Tamagotchi disappears into cyberspace\u2014forever. What remains is some stars and text saying how young the Tamagotchi was when it passed. (From diarrhea, probably.)\n\nDespite the creature being only a 10-pixel blob, school students were willing to earn themselves detention for checking on it during class rather than deal with an ill-timed death (the Tamagotchi\u2019s life was not pausable). In the United Kingdom, there were pet cemeteries that went so far as to dedicate sections of their lots specifically to the digital pets of children whose neglect resulted in the Tamagotchi\u2019s death. It all makes you wonder: Would millennials have ever learned to care for their offspring if not for the persistent grief of losing their beloved Tamagotchi?\n\nThis \u201ccontinual play\u201d feature, which the Tamagotchi was one of the first to utilize, was revolutionary in the video game industry.

This is because taking a multivitamin in the morning helps to ensure that it is absorbed and used by the body throughout the day. Additionally, studies have shown that taking a multivitamin in the morning can help to improve overall nutrient intake and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer. It's important to note, however, that individual needs may vary, and it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional before making any changes to your diet or supplement routine.","rejected":"A recent medical study published in Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that there is no significant benefit to taking a daily multivitamin as it does not reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, or cognitive decline.

{"prompt":"given this background information\n<start of reference>\nAlbert Delin  (17 April 1712, Ath \u2013 26 Nov 1771, Tournai; also known as Albertus Delin) was a harpsichord maker in the Low Countries.\n\nBiography\nBorn in Ath in Southern Netherlands (now in Belgium), he soon moved to the nearby town of Tournai to practice his trade. Little is known of his training but a remarkable number of his instruments have survived. His building style is quite contrary to his more famous contemporaries, like his neighbours Dulckens in Antwerp, the Hass family in Hamburg or the Taskins of Paris, that at the time created complex machines with an extensive variety of registers and knee levers. Delin's surviving instruments are simple, reminiscent of the old Ruckers instruments of a century before and of good workmanship as witnessed by the number of surviving instruments.\n\nSurviving instruments\nTwo surviving harpsichords (1750 and1768), both have a single manual and have only two 8' choirs and a buff stop, with all battens protruding through the instruments side, similar to original Ruckers instruments.\nKottick mentions four bentside spinets (1763, 1765, 1766, 1770), all with a single 8' choir.  A colorful fifth bentside spinet signed \"A.D. 1738\" and bearing a rose with the initials AD, has been attributed to him as well.\nThree clavicytheria (1751, 1752, 1760), strung like his harpsichords with two 8' registers, and guidebattens protruding through the cheek. The clavicytheria have an elegant pivot mechanism of Delins' own design, needing no spring action and only gravity for the return. Chung describes Delins clavicytherium thus: \"[he] succeeded in overcoming the difficulties of building an upright harpsichord better than any other builder. His three instruments, which are considered by many to be the finest of all surviving clavicytheria, have an amazingly fine touch that is achieved by a special action that upon the release of the keys allows the jacks to return without the need of springs or additional weights.\"\nThe last surviving instrument is even more old fashioned than the rest, a small, hexagonal, octave spinet (1750).\n\nDecor of the instruments\nDelin's original case decor seems to have been simple, but some of his instruments later received \"makeovers\". Most notably his 1760 clavicytherium, was retrofitted with an extravagant gilded, rococo door. The 1738 spinet is elaborately painted with a forest scene on the inside of the lid, while the case is covered with a menagerie of monkeys playing musical instruments.\n\nThe soundboard paintings in Delin's instruments are typical Flemish floral motifs, with visible outlines, flat coloring and little detail, a style similar to the Ruckers.\n\nBibliography\nJ.

{"prompt":"The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nThe Anhui clique () was a military and political organization, one of several mutually hostile cliques or factions that split from the Beiyang clique in the Republic of China's Warlord Era. It was named after Anhui province because several of its generals\u2013including its founder, Duan Qirui\u2013were born in Anhui.\n\nThe clique's main members were Duan Qirui, Duan Zhigui, Jin Yunpeng, Wang Yitang, Lu Yongxiang, Zhang Jingyao, Wu Guangxin, Chen Shufan, Zheng Shiqi, Xu Shuzheng, etc.\n\nBecause the Anhui clique organized itself very early, it was more politically sophisticated than its warlord rivals.\n\nHistory\nWith Japanese support and the suppression of the Manchu Restoration, it became the most powerful faction in China from 1916 to 1920.  They had an uneasy co-existence with the Zhili clique and Fengtian clique in the Beiyang government. They advocated a hardline during the Constitutional Protection War. The May Fourth Movement weakened their influence and eventually led to the Zhili\u2013Anhui War in 1920 which saw the surprise defeat of the Anhui clique. Duan resigned and the clique lacked national leadership for the next four years when all their provinces were eventually annexed by the Zhili clique by the summer of 1924. (Shandong was an anomaly, the Zhili clique appointed an Anhui general in 1923 there provided he remain neutral, see Shandong Problem. Zheng Shiqi ruled until 1925 when he transferred it to Fengtian's Zhang Zongchang per agreement with Duan.)  After the Beijing Coup, Feng Yuxiang and Zhang Zuolin picked Duan to lead a provisional government. Lacking any significant military power, he and his few remaining supporters played Feng and Zhang against each other. They removed him from power and his last followers joined the Fengtian clique.\n\nPolitical wing\nThey also had a political wing known as the Anfu Club (literally, Peace and Happiness Club, after a Beijing lane where they met; folk etymology claims it was a pun on Anhui and Fujian) which consisted of politicians that threw their fortune in with Duan. Formed on 7 March 1918 by Xu Shuzheng and Wang Yitang, it ran for elections for the northern National Assembly and won three-fourths of the seats primarily because Anhui warlords bought the votes. They were a highly disciplined party created to push Duan's agenda through legal means such as electing fellow party member Xu Shichang as President of the ROC. Before the Zhili\u2013Anhui War, it was also supported by the Fengtian clique, Xinjiang clique, and Shanxi clique. The Anhui clique was later destroyed after the Zhili-Anhui War when the Assembly was disbanded.\n\nFinancial wing\nTheir financial wing was the New Communications Clique (1916\u20131919) led by Cao Rulin.  It was the rival to Liang Shiyi's Old Communications Clique.

{"prompt":"given this background information\n<start of reference>\nThe idea of writing a note, rolling it up, placing it in a bottle, and throwing it out to sea is universally exciting. People have written songs, poems, and dramas about this simple act of hope that someone out there will hear your message. The possibility that someone might find it washed up on a beach on the other side of the world makes us all feel a little more connected. \n\nThe notion of throwing a message in a bottle out to sea was born when Greek philosopher Theophrastus did it to test his hypothesis that the Atlantic flows into the Mediterranean Sea around 310 BCE. Today, \u201cdrift bottles\u201d are used to study ocean currents, though only 4% of the bottles they throw into the ocean are ever found. \n\nToday we want to share 4 incredible true stories of messages in bottles that have washed up on a foreign shore.\n\n1. A 9-Year Journey\nOur first story begins in 2010 in Rockport, Massachusetts, where a ten-year-old Max Vredenburgh and his dad threw a message in a bottle out to sea. In their message, Max wrote his name, interests, and address in the hope that someone would find it and reply. \n\nTime went by and Max soon forgot the letter, but nine years later, the message was answered by someone called \u201cG Dubois,\u201d who lived in France, on the other side of the Atlantic. \n\nThe response said, \u201cIt will have taken 9 years to cover the 6000 kilometers that separate us. You\u2019ll have grown a lot during that time: 10 to 19 years old.\u201d\n\n2. A Message From the Titanic\nIrish cousins Nora Hegarty and Jeremiah Burke were passengers on the Titanic in 1912. Burke boarded the ship with a bottle of holy water, not thinking he\u2019d be using it for such a poignant purpose. \n\nAs the Titanic tragically began to descend into the sea, Burke scrawled the message, \u201cFrom Titanic, goodbye all, Burke of Glanmire, Cork,\u201d which he rolled up and put inside the holy water bottle. \n\nBoth he and his cousin perished, and a year later, the bottle washed up on the shore just a couple of miles from Burke\u2019s childhood home. This message in a bottle was kept in the family for almost 100 years until 2011 when it was donated to the Cobh Heritage Centre in the same town.\n\nLearn more about amazing ocean adventures\nEnter Your Email\n3. The Oldest Message in a Bottle\nThe oldest message in a bottle was found in 2018 by a family in Perth, Australia. Tonya and Kym Illman found the bottle while walking on a remote beach and brought it home, where they dried it carefully in the oven. When they unrolled the paper, they saw printed German that asked the reader to contact the German consulate. \n\nThe family also saw the faint date: 12 June 1886, but weren\u2019t sure it was real. Fortunately, they decided to take the bottle to the Western Australian Museum, where it was confirmed to be real. \n\nThe bottle is believed to have been thrown overboard on a journey from Cardiff in Wales to Indonesia, and likely washed up on the Australian coast within 12 months, where it was promptly buried under layers of sand. The Illman\u2019s timing was incredibly fortuitous. \n\nThe Illman family have now put the bottle and message on loan to the Western Australian Museum, where it is on display.\n\n4. Rescued After Throwing a Message into the Sea\nIn 2005, 88 South American migrants were adrift on a boat off the coast of Costa Rica. The boat they were being smuggled on became damaged, and the smugglers left them to their fate, floating adrift.\n\nAfraid for their lives, some of the women on board saw fishermen\u2019s lines in the water, and came up with the idea of tying a message in a bottle to one of the lines in the hope of getting their cry for help into the hands of someone who could help them. \n\nShortly after, the fishing vessel found the note and alerted the authorities at the Cocos Island national park. They paid an independent company to investigate, who rescued the migrants.\n<end of reference>\nSummarize the listed messages in the bottle stories and and simplify what happened.","chosen":"Four incredible stories of messages in bottles that have washed up on foreign shores are shared.\n\n1.

{"prompt":"given this background information\n<start of reference>\nAfter spending the night at the Park Inn by Radisson Oslo Airport, we decided to visit the SAS Museum before riding the train into the city. The museum is only open on Sundays and Tuesdays, so we couldn\u2019t pass up the chance to check it out given that it aligned with our schedule.\nThe SAS Museum is located sort of directly across the runway from the main terminal. If you could just walk out across the tarmac, you\u2019d be there in a jiffy.\nBut instead, you have to go the long way around which would make it about a 3-mile trek. My wife vetoed that so we took the bus from the airport terminal.\nWe bought our bus tickets from a transit desk at the airport. At about $4 each way, the tickets aren\u2019t cheap for what amounts to a less than 10-minute ride. The bus runs once or twice an hour, depending on the time of day, so you might have to wait a bit.\nThe SAS Museum has its own bus stop, but you still need to pay attention so you don\u2019t miss it.\nWe pretty much had the place to ourselves. I think there might have been one other family there at the time.\nThere were two older guys working when we arrived. I assume they were retired SAS employees who volunteer at the museum and I would have loved to chat with them as I\u2019m sure they had some great stories to tell. But alas, they didn\u2019t speak much English. So we smiled, exchanged pleasantries, and headed on in.\nThe museum itself is a fantastic collection of SAS memorabilia. It seems that every square foot of wall space is covered with some sort of photo, poster, or other artifact from SAS\u2019s long history.\nThe first exhibit you come to is a mock-up of a plane.\nThe cockpit of the mock-up includes a flight simulator which was staffed by one of the volunteers. He seemed to enjoy helping the kids get the plane in the air and then turning them loose to fly around Bergen, Norway.\nWe sort of left the kids to fly the plane and used our time to see the rest of the museum while occasionally coming back to check on them. There is display case after display case of memorabilia, pretty much everything you can imagine from SAS\u2019s history.\nOne of my favorite parts of the museum was the exhibit covering the early polar routes. I had never really thought about it, but it makes sense that SAS would have played a significant role in the development of these fascinating routes over the top of the world. \nThe main exhibit space has a loft at one end. A collection of SAS advertising posters lines the ramp to the upper level.\nThe balcony has the collection of flight attendant uniforms as well as an early check-in kiosk.\nSAS was a founding member of Star Alliance, a fact of which they are quite proud, so many of the other Star Alliance airlines are also represented. I was happy to see the United tulip instead of the globe.\nBy this point our kids were mostly done flying crashing the simulator but were ready to check out the kids area. Among other activities, it had one of the Lego airplanes. As it should. There are different versions of vintage seats to try while you\u2019re waiting for the kids.\nAnd then it was nearly closing time so we made our way to the door. On the way out, I noticed what I thought might be a Star Gold lounge and started to pull out my United Premium 1K card to gain entry. But then I realized it was the museum cafe, which was closed. I\u2019m not sure when or if it\u2019s open.\nWe then headed outside to catch the bus back to the terminal and from there the NSB train into the city.\nTips For visiting The SAS Museum\nThe hours are very limited. The SAS museum is open noon to 4 PM on Sunday and 10 AM to 3 PM on Tuesday.\nWe took bus 855 from and to the airport. The stop is directly in front of the museum. If you\u2019re arriving by car, there is a huge parking lot across the street. It also seems like it would be possible to walk from the airport. I don\u2019t think all of the roads have sidewalks, but they were quiet enough that you could probably walk on the side or in the grass beside the road.\nI don\u2019t recall any food being served at the museum, despite the presence of the cafe, so bring your own snacks.\nA lot of the exhibits are only in Norwegian, but with the kids, I don\u2019t really have enough time to read everything anyway.\nThe SAS Museum is a must for fans of SAS, Star Alliance, or the history of polar exploration.\nIt\u2019s only open for a few hours on each of two days per week, and takes a bit of effort to get to, but it\u2019s well worth it if you have a long layover at the Oslo Airport and can make it fit your schedule.\n<end of reference>\nUsing the passage provided, can you give me an extractive summary?

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nRocked by the loss of its top-rated opinion host Tucker Carlson, Fox News has overhauled its prime-time lineup in an effort to reverse its recent ratings declines.\n\nThe Rupert Murdoch-owned conservative news channel announced that Jesse Watters \u2014 who has hosted a 7 p.m. Eastern program since Jan. 2021 \u2014 will move to the 8 p.m. slot previously held by Carlson. Watters will remain a co-host on \u201cThe Five.\u201d\n\nFox News is also moving Greg Gutfeld\u2019s talk show \u201cGutfeld!\u201d an hour earlier, to 10 p.m. Eastern. The program is often the most watched show on the network among the 25-to-54 age group coveted by advertisers.\nThe program - which has been touted as conservative-leaning late night comedy alternative - can potentially attract more viewers at an earlier hour.\n\nLaura Ingraham, the conservative host who has held the 10 p.m. Eastern slot, moves to 7 p.m. Sean Hannity\u2019s nightly program remains at 9 p.m. Eastern. Fox News @ Night, the newscast currently airing at midnight, will move to 11 p.m. Eastern.\n\nThe new lineup takes effect July 17.\n\nScheduling moves are rare on the top-rated cable news channel and were prompted by the sudden dismissal of Carlson, which came just days after Fox News reached a $787.5-million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems over the network\u2019s false statements about voter fraud in the 2020 election.\nCarlson, an influential right-wing voice whose inflammatory comments about race and immigration made him a magnet for controversy, was pushed out amid the legal issues facing Fox News.\n\nThe host and the network are being sued by a former producer who alleges she was subjected to a hostile work environment while employed on Carlson\u2019s program. Evidence in the Dominion case showed Carlson making derogatory remarks about Fox News colleagues and management.\n\nBut since Carlson\u2019s departure, Fox News has seen a dramatic decline in the 8 p.m. hour, losing half of the 3 million viewers who were tuning in nightly. The loss has hurt the rest of the Fox News line-up, even though it remains ahead of its top competitors CNN and MSNBC.\nWatters, 44, has long been popular among Fox News viewers. \u201cThe Five,\u201d a round-table program where he holds the center chair, is the network\u2019s most-watched show, and his 7 p.m. Eastern program draws around 2 million viewers.\n\nHe got his start on Bill O\u2019Reilly\u2019s Fox News program, where he did ambush interviews of figures targeted by the host who departed in 2017. Watters often plays his role as provocateur with tongue in cheek and is prone to making outrageous statements.\nIn late 2021, Watters made incendiary comments about Dr. Anthony Fauci at Turning Point USA\u2019s Americafest, a right-wing conference. He used violent language when telling audience members they should confront the infectious disease expert with questions about the origins of the coronavirus.\n\n\u201cNow you go in for the kill shot,\u201d said Watters, according to a video clip of his appearance. \u201cThe kill shot with an ambush, deadly, because he doesn\u2019t see it coming. This is when you say, \u2018Dr. Fauci, you funded risky research at a sloppy Chinese lab, the same lab that sprung this pandemic on the world.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe Fox News round table show \"The Five\" is now the most watched hour on cable news.\nIn describing the impact of such a confrontation, Watters said, \u201cBoom! He is dead! He is dead! He\u2019s done!\u201d\n\nThe network stood by Watters after the remarks were denounced by Fauci and other critics. \u201cIt\u2019s more than clear that Jesse Watters was using a metaphor for asking hard-hitting questions to Dr. Fauci,\u201d a Fox News statement said at the time.\n\nFollowing Carlson\u2019s departure, Fox News tried a number of hosts in the 8 p.m. Eastern hour, but none approached the ratings that Watters attracted at 7 p.m. Even with the declines, the network has kept its hold on first place in the ratings.\n\nFox News has a history of replacing hosts who leave the network. The media industry expected a downturn after O\u2019Reilly was ousted over sexual harassment allegations. But Carlson, a cable news journeyman when he arrived, pumped up his rhetoric and became a polarizing star.\n\nCarlson continues to get paid by Fox News, which can keep him off the air through his contract which runs through 2024. He has relaunched his program on Twitter, which prompted Fox News to send a cease and desist letter saying he is in violation of his deal which pays him more than $15 million annually.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nI work for the LA Times, and I need you to write a news headline summarizing the recent prime-time lineup changes at Fox News.","chosen":"\"Fox News moves prime-time lineup to replace top-rated host\"","rejected":"The changes at Fox News, in response to the loss of Tucker Carlson, are detailed in this article."}

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\nZoo Legacy is a hip-hop\/indie-rock band from Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Formed in 2010, the band began as an outlet for brothers Samuel (keyboards, guitars, vocals) and Dominic Goss (guitars). After successfully recording a demo of material, the brothers enlisted the talents of friend and local rapper Nicholas Pouponneau in the summer of 2010, who began rapping verses over the instrumental tracks they had previously written. They obtained their name by combining the previous stage name of Pouponneau (Young Legacy) and a neighborhood park the Goss brothers spent time in visiting family in South Africa (Zoo Lake). Throughout the years, they have shared the stage with acts such as Lauryn Hill, Kardinal Offishall, Classified, Shad, Ubiquitous Synergy Seeker, SonReal and BadBadNotGood. Their sound has been likened to acts like The Weeknd, The XX and Atmosphere.\n\nHistory\n\n2011\u20132012\nIn October 2011, the band added Mark Milloy (drums) to its roster, who had been introduced to the band's members through a mutual acquaintance. After building up a repertoire of new music, which included input from new members Poupponeau and Milloy, the band began playing gigs in the National Capital Region and beyond. Early reviews of the band's music were positive; their song Shockwave was listed as a \"best local song\" of the year in the Ottawa Citizen. The Guardian (UK) also featured Zoo Legacy's track Shockwave on its website. Positive press continued with inclusion of their track 'Never' on the Before The Bigs compilation 'Best You've Never Heard' Volume 5.\n\n2012 found the band playing in Toronto for the NXNE festival, as well as the JunoFest in Ottawa, in support of the 2012 Juno Awards ceremony. The band's biggest show to date was at the 2012 RBC Royal Bank Ottawa Bluesfest, when they opened for Ms. Lauryn Hill. Other acts playing the same day included Snoop Dogg and ASAP Rocky.  Wrapping up a successful year, in a 'best-of' poll for 2012,  Zoo Legacy was in the top 20 songs of Ottawa artists as rated by the Ottawa Citizen. Earlier that year, the Citizen had referred to Zoo Legacy as being a part of Ottawa's 'golden age of hip hop'.  Ottawa Xpress also included Zoo Legacy on their 'Sounds of Ottawa' 2012 list. Outside of their home turf, Zoo Legacy was also honoured by receiving the \"Best Urban Act\" award from the Toronto Independent Music Awards. Additionally, they were featured on the blog 1 Love T.O. and Canadian music channel MuchMusic.\n\n2013\u20132015\n2013 was a busy year for the band. In April, they were fortunate to play a gig at the acclaimed Soho House in Toronto with up-and-coming rappers the Airplane Boys. In June, the band's music was featured in the trailer for the film Liars All, in addition to being featured on the blog of Drake's producer, Boi-1da. Later that year, the band were finalists in the Live 88.5 ran Big Money Shot competition, an endeavour that had the band working with acclaimed producer Tomi Swick (Barenaked Ladies).\n\nAfter a successful Kickstarter campaign in Spring 2014, the band temporarily re-located to Brooklyn to record with producer Gus van Go, notable for his work with the band The Stills and Hollerado. The band played the Canadian Music Week, the Canadian Tulip Festival, and the newly formed E.L.E. Music Festival, which is hosted annually at the University of Ottawa. Their performance at the E.L.E. festival was included by CBC as a top 4 music show to see that weekend. They also undertook their first Ontario tour, named the \"Flight Risk Tour\", with stops in Toronto, Kingston, London, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener and Ottawa, with an out-of-province date in Montreal, Quebec.\n\n2015 commenced with the finishing of the Departures EP, with recording occurring at Audio Valley Studios in Ottawa, ON. Shortly after, the band released a rework of the Hudson Mohawke track \"Chimes\".

It had briefly been associated with Prince \"Vlad the Impaler,\" whose cruelty inspired novelist Bram Stoker's creation, the vampire Count Dracula.\n\nIn 1938, Princess Ileana, daughter of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie, inherited the castle, which is perched high on a rock and surrounded by snowcapped mountains.\n\nIt was confiscated by the communist government in 1948, when the Romanian royals were forced to leave the country.\n\nHabsburg and his sisters Maria-Magdalena Holzhousen and Elisabeth Sandhofen took part Friday in a ceremony confirming the castle's return \u2014 part of Romania's efforts to repair past injustices and return confiscated properties.\n\n\"I don't have enough words to thank the people of Romania for not allowing this injustice to continue,\" said Habsburg, 68, who recalled growing up and going to school in the mountain village, now a tourist resort with 6,500 residents.\n\n\"We can't turn back time or repair mistakes but this means justice,\" he added in Romanian. \"The name of Bran and this castle should always be a symbol of justice and honor in Romania, the country my ancestors and I always loved.\"\n\nHabsburg said he did not want the castle's name to be associated with Dracula.\n\n\"We are talking about a fable, a novel, I don't think that's OK,\" Habsburg said, adding that he will meet with the people of Bran to discuss plans for the castle.\n\nOn Friday, Habsburg signed an agreement with Culture Minister Adrian Iorgulescu to keep the castle open to visitors for the next three years.\n\n\"Almost everybody in Bran works in the tourist trade,\" said Nicu Solovastru, 53, who was selling sheep cheese and plum brandy near the castle. He said he hoped it would remain a tourist destination.\n\nMore than 400,000 visitors a year, most of them foreign, visit the castle \u2014 mainly because of its loose association with the legendary Prince Vlad, who punished wrongdoers or the lazy by impaling them on stakes. He once impaled all the elderly people in a community in an act of revenge following the killing of his father and brother.\n\nVlad did not own the castle, but is believed to have used it briefly during his incursions in Transylvania. He is also believed to have been imprisoned in the castle for two months in 1462 when he was captured by a rival Hungarian king.\n\nUnlike Vlad's castle in Poenari, which is in ruins, Bran Castle is well preserved and tourists prefer it. It features a secret exit, and a secret corridor allowing defenders to leave in case of siege.\n\nMany in the nearby village earn a living from selling Dracula souvenirs, such as wooden figurines and paintings with Vlad's face and \"Vampire\" wine, as well as wooden chess sets and hand-knitted sweaters. Locals have opened dozens of small bed-and- breakfast accommodations, as Bran has drawn more tourists since the end of communism in 1990.\n\nThe castle is decorated with Queen Marie's furniture and family pictures.\n\nDuring World War II, Habsburg and his sisters worked at a local hospital that their mother ran, he told The Associated Press. He said the royal family hid American and British citizens when Romania was allied with Germany from 1941 to 1944, and later during the Soviet occupation hid ethnic Germans. Tens of thousands of ethnic Germans were deported from Transylvania to labor camps in the Soviet Union.\n\n\"I think it's a normal thing that they are giving the castle back to the royal family.

{"prompt":"Reference:\nIt might ward off vampires, but it attracted millions of to tiny Gilroy, California, over the 30 years that the town celebrated its annual Garlic Festival (until its COVID-related cancellation in 2020). Besides being known for wine (Gilroy sits at the southern tip of the Santa Clara Valley AVA), Gilroy is the undisputed garlic capital of the U.S., growing 50%\u2014and processing 90%\u2014of the nation\u2019s garlic harvest. It\u2019s worth a visit year-round for the many garlic-infused products for sale (ice cream, jelly, popcorn) and the subtle but pervasive scent of garlic that led Will Rogers to say, \u201cGilroy is the only town I know where you can marinate a steak by hanging it on the clothesline.\u201d When pairing with garlic-heavy dishes, take into account which of its flavors are taking center stage.\n\nPungent\nWhen cut, raw garlic releases sulfurous compounds that create its characteristically complex pungency. A high-acid white wine can cut the bite of garlic in much the same way that citrus does in a salad dressing. Dry Furmint (the primary grape in sweet Tokaji Asz\u00fa wines) brims with sharp citrus, boasts a saline streak and hints at garlic\u2019s best pal, ginger. Grab it when you can find it.\n\nTip: When mincing or crushing garlic, wait at least 10 seconds before adding to anything acidic or to a hot pan. Acid and heat inhibit the enzymatic process from which raw garlic gets its power.\nSpicy\nGarlic doesn\u2019t contain capsaicin, the source of tongue-searing heat in chili peppers, but if you chew a clove of raw garlic, your mouth will hardly know the difference. However, while capsaicin is difficult to pair with red wine, garlic welcomes wines with complementary spicy flavors. With its charcuterie and pepper notes, cool-climate Syrah\u2014northern Rh\u00f4ne, Adelaide Hills, Central Coast California\u2014is a natural choice.\n\nSweet\nAs it cooks, garlic\u2014 especially whole cloves\u2014releases a deep sweetness, which is why roasted and braised dishes can absorb quantities of garlic that would overwhelm uncooked dressing or dips. Oloroso Sherry is usually a dry wine, but its rich texture and intensely nutty, oxidized flavors give it a mouth-filling roundness that plays well with dishes that straddle sweet and savory.\n\nUmami\nThis fifth flavor is deeply savory (think dry-aged meat, blue cheese, mushrooms), and roasted and black garlic, in particular, are full of it. Garlic\u2019s umami quality is why it adds such depth to so many dishes around the world. Tannins can clash with umami, so try a crisp and low-tannin red like those from Austria\u2019s Zweigelt grape. It makes easy-drinking wines full of red fruit and a whiff of garlic-friendly black pepper.\n\n*Black garlic is fresh garlic that\u2019s been aged under controlled heat and humidity to induce the Maillard reaction, which turns it black, sticky and sweet\nRecipe: Chicken with 40 Cloves of Garlic\nGenerously salt and pepper 8 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs and place, skin side down, in a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until deep golden brown. Remove to a plate. Add \u00bd cup dry white wine, scrape up brown bits until liquid almost evaporates, then add chicken, 40 garlic cloves, and \u00bd cup extra-virgin olive oil.

However to GOD, all sin is evil including swearing and adultery. Yes, terrorism is blatantly evil, but so is the way I hurt someone's feelings when I am inconsiderate.

Thank GOD for the precious Blood of CHRIST.\n\nWhen we surrender our lives to CHRIST and invite the HOLY SPIRIT to come fully into our lives, the HOLY SPIRIT will come in and help us to fight the satanic evil that terrorizes and incites everyone to commit evil acts: both big and small.

{"prompt":"The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nCrepidula convexa is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Calyptraeidae, the slipper snails or slipper limpets, cup-and-saucer snails, and Chinese hat snails. The maximum recorded shell length is 20\u00a0mm.\n\nDistribution\nThis species is native to the eastern coasts of North and Central America, from Canada to Panama.\n\nHabitat\nThe minimum recorded depth at which this species has been found is 0 m (i.e. at the sea surface); the maximum recorded depth is 70 m.\n\nLocation\nCrepidula convexa can be found along the East coast of North America. Geographically they can be found in the Low intertidal zone (5 to 10 meters) and to roughly about 200 meters down into the shallow subtidal zone. Predominantly on rocks, shells and sea grass.\n\nDescription\nThe shell of the Crepidula convexa can be described as oval shape. This mostly due to the shell needing to meet the needs of its environment.  They vary depending on the exact location of them being in sea grass or in the rocks. Those located in seagrass are oftentimes smaller and have a steeper arch then their counterparts located in rocky areas. The snail varies in shades of cocoa, often having spots or streaks on the shell. Rarely do some have purple tints near the apex. The shelf is flat or slightly convex and the left side extends farther forward then it does the right side. The typical maximum Crepidula convexa will grow up to 20\u00a0mm in length.\n\nDevelopment\nCrepidula convexa follows a sequential hermaphroditism life cycle. During its life it will pass through 5 sexual phases. The immature phase where it is in the larval stage and has no need to start sexual reproduction but shows a slight rise on the right side of the neck where the phallus will later grow. Next when hatched the snail will be in what is called the \u201cPhallus Bud\u201d stage which is the forming of the male sexual organ and may have a \u201cpeg-like\u201d phallus. Soon after it will have developed a full phallus and be deemed a \u201cMale\u201d, where it can start the sexual reproduction process and fertilize its female counterparts. Later on it will start to change and grow into a \u201cTransitional\u201d where the male starts to grow and loses the ability to fertilize and start to become female. Finally it will be a \u201cFemale\u201d which will be its final sexual phase. At that point it will be able to be inseminated and lay eggs and may have a remnant of a degenerate phallus.\n\nReproduction  \nDuring a single breeding season the larger female will only have one male partner. On the other hand males may mate with multiple females. This increases the survivability rate of the species because there is always an abundance of females than males. The smaller males have greater mobility which allows them to mate more and increase reproductive capacity for the species in a given area.\n\nPopulation structure\nThe genetic structure of Crepidula convexa differs distinctively based on the location of the species. The genetics of a specific snail of this species from Florida can be separated from another found in New England. Samples of Crepidula convexa in the south may have faster growth rates and thus shorter life spans due to higher ph levels, but it is still an arguable science as to why they have faster growth rate than their counterparts in other regions. These snails are not equipped to travel long distances to migrate. They live on the shells of other organisms, some being seagrass. This can be attributed to short distance gene flow. They may \u201cpiggyback\u201d a ride on horseshoe crabs to warmer regions they are not necessarily native too.\n\nFrom the text, extract the average and maximum size of the Crepidula convexa sea snail in the North East region of the United States.

I belong to neither group. This idea gets rejected by the religious community that is so entrenched in the literal interpretation of their religious literature that they won't accept it. Then you have the scientific community that demands empirical data and tangible or physical evidence that they can see. With the latter, it's possible if the scientific community adjusts their way of looking at the information. However, even if they do, it could still take another good 100 years before they'll come around. I'll be dead by then.\n\nMy plight that I mentioned in Volume 7 regarding \"Mr. Holland's Opus\" is where they cut the music program. There's not enough money. There are budget cuts. After 8 years of doing this research on my own with money out of my own pocket and being out of the work force that long, I'm just financially spent. If you read my SmashWords bio, my basic game plan is to publish a whole bunch of books on Cryptology for free because I just can't in good conscience charge money for what I learned from the Planet. It just makes you feel really cheap and dirty profiting off the Planet that gave you life.\n\nI'm putting in the time to put out these books on Cryptology for free. Then I can move on with my life and start writing books on other stuff where I can charge so that I can start finally pulling in revenues so I can have food to eat and roof over my head. Hopefully, I'll be able to establish myself as an author so that I can use the money made from books I sell to fund my continued research in the field of Cryptology. That's the game plan. It's not a very good plan, but it's the only plan I've got so far.\n\nI probably could've driven the point home about state dates with the final chapter of Volume 7 by pointing out the link that singer Pink) has to \"Charlie's Angels.\" Pink was born 9\/8 of 1979. The Nativity of the Virgin Mary is kept on 9\/8.\n\n1) Actor John Forsythe symbolized the Voice of God\n\n2) John Forsythe was born 1\/29 of 1918\n\n3)  Kansas became a state on 1\/29 of 1861\n\n4) Morgan Freeman, who played God in \"Bruce Almighty,\" is born 6\/1 of 1937\n\n5) Alanis Morissette, who played God in \"Dogma,\" is born 6\/1 of 1974\n\n6)  Kentucky became a state on 6\/1 of 1792\n\n7)  Tennessee became a state on 6\/1 of 1796\n\nIf you are familiar with the 2000 movie \"Charlie's Angels,\" Sam Rockwell, born 11\/5, turns out to be the villain. (Sorry if I spoiled the ending for you.) In the second movie, Robert Patrick, born 11\/5 like Sam Rockwell, turns out to be the other disguised villain in \"Charlie's Angels 2: Full Throttle.\" So the hidden villain in both movies shared a birthday on 11\/5.\n\nIn the second movie, the story splits off where there are 2 major villains.\n\n1) Justin Theroux, playing Seamus O'Grady, was born 8\/10 of 1971\n\n2)  Missouri became a state on 8\/10 of 1821\n\n3) Demi Moore, playing Madison Lee, was born 11\/11 of 1962\n\n4)  Washington became a state on 11\/11 of 1889\n\nSo you have 2 movies with a God theme where the villains are born on 11\/5. Then in the second movie, the story splinters off where there are 2 other villains born on state dates of Missouri and Washington in opposition to the person symbolizing God linked to the state of Kansas. This aligns with other actors born on state dates who played the role of God as well as the God Particle as the Higgs Boson named after Peter Ware Higgs born 5\/29 when Rhode Island and Wisconsin became states.\n\nThat's a lot of state dates. Throughout my volume set, I've been citing state dates staking the claim that anything tied to God or linked to God may have something to do with calendar dates when states joined the Union.\n###\n\nWhat is the main topic or theme of the text?","chosen":"The main topic of the text is a man's frustration with the scientific community's and religious community's lack of understanding of his work in Cryptology.

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nBefore You Go is a 1960 novel by Jerome Weidman, published by Random House.\n\nPlot Summary\n\nIn 1943, Italian American soldier Julie Sarno is doing a routine secretarial job at a United States Army office in wartime London, the most risky part of her job being to avoid the unwanted amorous advances of a womanizing  general. Suddenly, she is taken in complete secrecy to the Carlton Hotel and told that she has an assignment which can influence the course of the war. Ben Ivey, a senior White House official of President Roosevelt's inner circle, has secretly arrived in London on a vital mission, having to do with the forthcoming invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe - and then been struck by a mysterious, incapacitating  malady. Doctors can do nothing to help him, and he insisted that Julie is the only person who can help him.\n\nIn fact, Julie had known Ben Ivey for sixteen years. As readers learn from the flashbacks which form a large part of the plot, she first met him in 1927 - when she was a precocious 11-year-old girl and he was a young social worker at a local settlement house in the Lower East Side slum where she grew up. At one time she had been madly in love with him, later she came to greatly hate and despise him because of a tragic love triangle involving herself, him and her beloved elder sister Celia.\n\nThe book follows back and forth this tangled relationship, from the slum childhood, through an Oregon land-reclamation project in the early years of the New Deal, and up to the tense standoff at the hotel room in WWII London. In the final chapters, secrets which have been suppressed for many years come out at last. On the highly emotional development of the protagonists' personal relationships hinges the success of a major WWII military operation, involving thousands of soldiers, numerous civilians living under Nazi occupation, a risky mission behind enemy lines, and the young exile King of a Scandinavian country.\n\nCritical reception\n\nKirkus Reviews noted that \"Her [julie's] success and her challenging of Ben light up the dark memories of their earlier associations and indicate a change for the future.

Deepika and Ranveer\u2019s extremely private wedding happened in the presence of their families and close friends. Wedding ceremonies serve several purposes and they are often a cherished moment in a couple\u2019s lives. A wedding ceremony is often utilized as a public display of marriage vows and of the couple entering into the marital contract. For most couples, the focus of the wedding ceremony is on their commitment and love for each other.\n\nThe most important part of any wedding ceremony is the words utilized to proclaim never-ending love and appreciation between each unique couple. A wedding ceremony will include other elements, such as an offering of the love and support of family and friends present. In addition, a religious wedding ceremony helps couples commit their relationship to God (in a temple, church, or mosque).\n\nHindu marriages are based on age-old traditions that have been translated into laws. According to traditions, a Hindu marriage cannot be reversed and is irrevocable. The modern-day Hindu Marriage laws prohibit Polygamy or Polyandry. In India as well as most Hindu cultures across the world, arranged marriages are still the most preferred way of getting hitched. Consent and happiness of the families are of utmost importance in Hindu culture as marriage is not only a union of two souls but also the union of two families!\n\nEven in this age of high-tech living, where life has become like a fast-forward movie, wedding is still considered important to many people around the world. Most of the religious sectors view it as a necessary and sacred undertaking in order to adhere to their basic teachings. Christianity for example, has many wedding ceremonies that are practiced in every nation that believes in it. Muslims have their own traditions and practices also in celebrating wedding events. Although a polygamous lifestyle is allowed by them, a wedding is still an important event in the life of a Muslim believer.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, we are witnessing many couples who live together without getting formally married. But, it is still not accepted wholeheartedly by the larger society. Couples say, we have accepted each other and are committed to each other. But, when you participate in a wedding ceremony, you\u2019ll be asked to talk about your commitments. And your answer is always on the confirmatory. There are of course some exceptions like some couples who live under one roof and got married just for the sake of convenience.\n\nYou rarely see someone who is not excited about getting married. Most of the people are thrilled with the exception of those under pressure when their wedding was held. A wedding is one of the most important events in the life of a person. It\u2019s the start of the process of building a family. A wedding is the symbol of commitment and the foundation of your love for your partner. Building a warm home starts with choosing your partner for life. And this is officiated in a ceremony called a wedding.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nAs you read this sentence, you probably think that this moment\u2014right now\u2014is what is happening. The present moment feels special. It is real. However much you may remember the past or anticipate the future, you live in the present. Of course, the moment during which you read that sentence is no longer happening. This one is. In other words, it feels as though time flows, in the sense that the present is constantly updating itself. We have a deep intuition that the future is open until it becomes present and that the past is fixed. As time flows, this structure of fixed past, immediate present, and open future gets carried forward in time. This structure is built into our language, thoughts, and behavior. How we live our lives hangs on it.\n\nYet as natural as this way of thinking is, you will not find it reflected in science. The equations of physics do not tell us which events are occurring right now\u2014they are like a map without the \u201cyou are here\u201d symbol. The present moment does not exist in them, and therefore neither does the flow of time. Additionally, Albert Einstein\u2019s theories of relativity suggest not only that there is no single special present but also that all moments are equally real [see \u201cThat Mysterious Flow,\u201d by Paul Davies; Scientific American, September 2002]. Fundamentally, the future is no more open than the past.\n\nThe gap between the scientific understanding of time and our everyday understanding of time has troubled thinkers throughout history. It has widened as physicists have gradually stripped time of most of the attributes we commonly ascribe to it. Now the rift between the time of physics and the time of experience is reaching its logical conclusion, for many in theoretical physics have come to believe that time fundamentally does not even exist.\n\nThe idea of a timeless reality is initially so startling that it is hard to see how it could be coherent. Everything we do, we do in time. The world is a series of events strung together by time. Anyone can see that my hair is graying, that objects move, and so on. We see change, and change is the variation of properties concerning time. Without time, the world would be completely still. A timeless theory faces the challenge of explaining how we see change if the world is not changing.\n\nRecent research attempts to perform just this feat. Although time may not exist at a fundamental level, it may arise at higher levels\u2014just as a table feels solid even though it is a swarm of particles composed mostly of space. Solidity is a collective, or emergent, property of the particles. Time, too, could be an emergent property of whatever the basic ingredients of the world are.\n\nThis concept of emergent time is potentially as revolutionary as the development of the theories of relativity and quantum mechanics a century ago. Einstein said that the key step forward in developing relativity was his reconceptualization of time. As physicists pursue their dream of unifying relativity with quantum mechanics, they believe that time is again central. In 2008 the Foundational Questions Institute (FQXi) sponsored an essay contest on the nature of time and a veritable who\u2019s who of modern physics weighed in. Many held that a unified theory will describe a timeless world. Others were loath to get rid of time. The one thing they agreed on was that without thinking deeply about time, progress on unification may well be impossible.\n###\nAct as if you are a professor grading a research paper. To what degree, on a scale of 1-7 (1 = proven, 4 = partially proven, 7 = hypothesis) would you rate this theory that time is an illusion?

They argue that time is a human construct that we use to make sense of the world around us, and that it does not exist independently of human perception.\n\nHowever, there are also counterarguments to this theory. Some physicists and scientists argue that time is a fundamental property of the universe, and that it cannot be explained away as an illusion. They point to the fact that time appears to operate consistently and predictably, and that it is an essential component of many physical laws and phenomena.\n\nIn conclusion, the theory that time is an illusion is a fascinating and complex one that has been debated by philosophers, scientists, and thinkers for centuries.

{"prompt":"The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nWhile examining satellite imagery of an area near the North Korean capital city, the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK) and AllSource Analysis, Inc. (ASA) may have come across evidence of a ghastly sight: the public execution of several individuals by anti-aircraft machine gun fire.\n\nA military training area generally known as the Kanggon Military Training Area is located approximately 22 km north of the capital city Pyongyang (Pyongyang-si). Given the size, composition, and location of the training facility, it is likely used by both the students and staff of the elite Kanggon Military Academy (6 km to the southwest) and units from either the Pyongyang Defense Command or the Ministry of State Security. Encompassing approximately 12km2, the training area is composed of a number of dispersed small facilities. One of those facilities, located 1.5 km northeast of the small village of S\u014fngi-ri, is a small arms firing range (39. 13 48.64\u00b0 N, 125. 45 29.03\u00b0 E). This firing range is approximately 100 meters long by 60 meters wide and consists of 11 firing lanes. A range control\/viewing gallery and parking area are located immediately south of the firing range. A small drainage ditch horizontally bisects the firing range. This firing range is typical of many ranges throughout North Korea and is designed for small arms training and maintaining proficiency for weapons ranging from pistols to light machine guns, and chambered for 7.62mm (the standard AK-47 rifle round) or less.\n\nSometime on or about October 7th, 2014, some very unusual activity was noted on satellite imagery of the Kanggon small arms firing range. Instead of troops occupying the firing positions on the range there was a battery of six ZPU-4 anti-aircraft guns lined up between the firing positions and the range control\/viewing gallery. The ZPU-4 is an anti-aircraft gun system consisting of four 14.5mm heavy machine guns (similar to a U.S. .50 caliber heavy machine gun) mounted on a towed wheeled chassis. It is neither safe nor practical to use such weapons on a small arms range, as the combined weight of fire from the six ZPU-4 (a total of 24 heavy machine guns) would quickly destroy the downrange backstop and necessitate reconstruction. A few meters behind the ZPU-4s there appears to be either a line of troops or equipment, while farther back are five trucks (of various sizes), one large trailer, and one bus. This suggests that senior officers or VIPs may have come to observe whatever activity was taking place. Most unusual in the image, perhaps, is what appears to be some sort of targets located only 30 meters downrange of the ZPU-4s.\n\nThe satellite image appears to have been taken moments before an execution by ZPU-4 anti-aircraft machine guns. Busing in senior officers or VIPs to observe a ZPU-4 dry-fire training exercise at a small arms range amidst North Korea\u2019s fuel shortages would make no sense. If the ZPU-4s were brought to the range solely to be sighted in, conducting this exercise at a 100 meter small arms firing range would be impractical. A live-fire exercise would be even more nonsensical. Rounds fired by a ZPU-4 have a range of 8,000 m and can reach a maximum altitude of 5,000 m. Positioning a battery of six ZPU-4s to fire horizontally at targets situated only 30 m downrange could have no conceivable utility from a military viewpoint. The most plausible explanation of the scene captured in the October 7th satellite image is a gruesome public execution. Anyone who has witnessed the damage one single U.S. .50 caliber round does to the human body will shudder just trying to imagine a battery of 24 heavy machine guns being fired at human beings. Bodies would be nearly pulverized. The gut-wrenching viciousness of such an act would make \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d sound like a gross understatement.\n\nGiven reports of past executions this is tragic, but unfortunately plausible in the twisted world of Kim Jong-un\u2019s North Korea. In December 2013, following the execution of the leader\u2019s uncle Jang Song-thaek, Choe Sang-Hun and David Sanger reported for The New York Times that Jang Song-thaek\u2019s top two lieutenants had been executed using anti-aircraft machine guns. In the summer of 2013, South Korean intelligence officials and news media reported that purged North Korean artists had been executed using the same gruesome method.\n\nCan you give me a three paragraph summary of North Korea's unusual military training? I want it to be thorough and extensive. Each paragraph should contain at least five sentences each.","chosen":"In the vicinity of the North Korean capital city of Pyongyang, the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea (HRNK) and AllSource Analysis, Inc.

{"prompt":"Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nGryllus firmus, commonly known as the sand field cricket, is a species of cricket in the subfamily Gryllinae. It is found in the southeastern United States.\n\nDescription\nGryllus firmus is very similar in appearance to other crickets found in the southeastern United States, the southeastern field cricket (Gryllus rubens) and the Texas field cricket (Gryllus texensis). It has a black head and prothorax, and a brown abdomen. It can be distinguished from these two species by the coloration and venation of the forewing, but more particularly, by its call. Males of this species chirp while males of the other two species trill.\n\nDistribution and habitat\nGryllus firmus occurs in the coastal plain of the southeastern United States. Its range extends from Connecticut and New Hampshire to Florida and Texas. The long winged morph is migratory. It is replaced to the north and west of its range by the fall field cricket (Gryllus pennsylvanicus), and the two species hybridise to a limited extent where their ranges overlap. Its typical habitat is grassland, pasture, roadside verges and lawns on light, free-draining sandy soils.\n\nBiology\nGryllus firmus exhibits wing polymorphism; some individuals have fully functional, long hind wings and others have short wings and cannot fly. Females of the latter morph have smaller flight muscles, greater ovarian development and produce more eggs, so the polymorphism adapts the cricket for either dispersal or reproduction. In some long-winged individuals, the flight muscles deteriorate during adulthood and the insect's reproductive capabilities improve.\n\nG. firmus is unusual among field crickets in laying a mixture of two types of egg. Some eggs develop immediately and take two to four weeks to hatch, while others have a diapause, with delayed hatching taking place after from five to twenty-eight weeks. Individual females lay both egg types, with the proportion of the quick-developing types varying from 50% to 95%. Researchers hypothesize that this reproductive strategy is particularly appropriate for G. firmus because of the variability in the temperature and the soil moisture content in the sandy, fast-drying soils in which it lives. Unpredictable droughts are less likely to cause population collapses when the risk is spread in this way.\n###\n\nFrom the text, extract the information about the different types of eggs and the time it takes for them to hatch.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nResearchers have discovered the most distant active supermassive black hole to date with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The galaxy, CEERS 1019, existed about 570 million years after the big bang, and its black hole is less massive than any other yet identified in the early universe.\n\nIn addition to the black hole in CEERS 1019, the researchers identified two more black holes that are on the smaller side and existed 1 billion and 1.1 billion years after the big bang. JWST also identified eleven galaxies that existed when the universe was 470 million to 675 million years old. The evidence was provided by JWST's Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey, led by Steven Finkelstein, a professor of astronomy at The University of Texas at Austin. The program combines JWST's highly detailed near- and mid-infrared images and data known as spectra, all of which were used to make these discoveries.\n\n\"Looking at this distant object with this telescope is a lot like looking at data from black holes that exist in galaxies near our own,\" said Rebecca Larson, a recent Ph.D. graduate at UT Austin, who led the study. \"There are so many spectral lines to analyze!\"\n\nThe team has published these results in several initial papers in a special edition of The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\nCEERS 1019 is notable not only for how long ago it existed, but also how relatively little its black hole weighs. It clocks in around 9 million solar masses, far less than other black holes that also existed in the early universe and were detected by other telescopes. Those behemoths typically contain more than 1 billion times the mass of the sun -- and they are easier to detect because they are much brighter. The black hole within CEERS 1019 is more like the black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy, which is 4.6 million times the mass of the sun.\n\nThough smaller, this black hole existed so much earlier that it is still difficult to explain how it formed so soon after the universe began. Researchers have long known that smaller black holes must have existed earlier in the universe, but it wasn't until JWST began observing that they were able to make definitive detections.\n\nNot only could the team untangle which emissions in the spectrum are from the black hole and which are from its host galaxy, they could also pinpoint how much gas the black hole is ingesting and determine its galaxy's star-formation rate.\n\nThe team found this galaxy is ingesting as much gas as it can while also churning out new stars. They turned to the images to explore why that might be. Visually, CEERS 1019 appears as three bright clumps, not a single circular disk.\n\n\"We're not used to seeing so much structure in images at these distances,\" said CEERS team member Jeyhan Kartaltepe, an associate professor of astronomy at the Rochester Institute of Technology in New York. \"A galaxy merger could be partly responsible for fueling the activity in this galaxy's black hole, and that could also lead to increased star formation.\"\n\nThese are only the first groundbreaking findings from the CEERS Survey.\n\n\"Until now, research about objects in the early universe was largely theoretical,\" Finkelstein said. \"With Webb, not only can we see black holes and galaxies at extreme distances, we can now start to accurately measure them. That's the tremendous power of this telescope.\"\n\nIn the future, it's possible JWST's data may also be used to explain how early black holes formed, revising researchers' models of how black holes grew and evolved in the first several hundred million years of the universe's history.\n\nThe James Webb Space Telescope is an international program led by NASA with its partners, the European Space Agency and the Canadian Space Agency.\n\nMore Extremely Distant Black Holes and Galaxies\n\nThe CEERS Survey is expansive, and there is much more to explore. Team member Dale Kocevski of Colby College in Waterville, Maine, and the team quickly spotted another pair of small black holes in the data. The first, within galaxy CEERS 2782, was easiest to pick out. There isn't any dust obscuring JWST's view of it, so researchers could immediately determine when its black hole existed in the history of the universe -- only 1.1 billion years after the big bang. The second black hole, in galaxy CEERS 746, existed slightly earlier, 1 billion years after the big bang. Its bright accretion disk, a ring made up of gas and dust that encircles its supermassive black hole, is still partially clouded by dust.\n\n\"The central black hole is visible, but the presence of dust suggests it might lie within a galaxy that is also furiously pumping out stars,\" Kocevski explained.\n\nLike the one in CEERS 1019, the two other newly described black holes (in galaxies CEERS 2782 and CEERS 746) are also \"light weights\" -- at least when compared with previously known supermassive black holes at these distances. They are only about 10 million times the mass of the sun.\n\n\"Researchers have long known that there must be lower mass black holes in the early universe. Webb is the first observatory that can capture them so clearly,\" Kocevski said. \"Now we think that lower mass black holes might be all over the place, waiting to be discovered.\"\n\nBefore JWST, all three black holes were too faint to be detected.\n\n\"With other telescopes, these targets look like ordinary star-forming galaxies, not active supermassive black holes,\" Finkelstein added.\n\nJWST's sensitive spectra also allowed these researchers to measure precise distances to, and therefore the ages of, galaxies in the early universe. Team members Pablo Arrabal Haro of the National Science Foundation's NOIRLab and Seiji Fujimoto, a postdoctoral researcher and Hubble fellow at UT Austin, identified 11 galaxies that existed 470 million to 675 million years after the big bang. Not only are they extremely distant, the fact that so many bright galaxies were detected is notable. Researchers theorized that JWST would detect fewer galaxies than are being found at these distances.\n\n\"I am overwhelmed by the amount of highly detailed spectra of remote galaxies Webb returned,\" Arrabal Haro said. \"These data are absolutely incredible.\"\n\nThese galaxies are rapidly forming stars but are not yet as chemically enriched as galaxies that are much closer to home.\n\n\"Webb was the first to detect some of these galaxies,\" explained Fujimoto. \"This set, along with other distant galaxies we may identify in the future, might change our understanding of star formation and galaxy evolution throughout cosmic history,\" he added.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nUsing the article above, provide a concise summary of everything regarding the James Webb telescope.

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nIn vitro cell culture practices are valuable techniques to understand the mechanisms behind vital in vivo biological processes. In vitro cells have helped us to attain a deeper understanding of functions and mechanisms conserved in the course of evolution. Toxicology studies are inevitable in drug discovery, pesticide development, and many other fields that directly interact with human beings. The proper involvement and regulatory steps that have been taken by animal ethical societies in different parts of the world resulted in the reduced in vivo use of mammals in toxicological studies. Nevertheless, experimental animals are being killed where no replacement is available. The use of mammals could be reduced by using in vitro systems. Nowadays, invertebrate cell lines also play an important role in toxicology testing. This review analyzes the cause and consequence of insect in vitro models in toxicology studies.\nAcross centuries, research involving animals has contributed significantly to the progress of biomedical sciences. However, the use of animals in research experiments became a subject of controversy. The pain and suffering experienced by animals had arisen moral concerns which led to the anti-vivisection movement. In 1824, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals1, one of the oldest animal welfare charities was formed. Later in 1876, an act for preventing cruelty to animals was made in the UK. In India, parallel movements were initiated in the year 1960. Then, the Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986) came into existence and provided effective regulations enforced by law. During all these progressions, 3 Rs\u2014replacement, reduction, and refinement of animals' use in research have been proposed. The idea of \u201creplacement\u201d has led researchers to search for alternatives. It mainly relied on replacing experimental mammals like rabbits, rats, and pigs with non-mammalian systems. Invertebrate models and micro-organisms were also introduced as a replacement for vertebrate models. Most of the intriguing biological questions could be addressed using a lower group of organisms. \nInvertebrates have made significant contributions in biomedical research as most of their organs and their physiology are analogous to mammals. Biomedical research using invertebrates has appeared in the scientific literature since the 1900s. They range from terrestrial invertebrates to freshwater and marine beings, including crustaceans and mollusks. During the last decade, articles published in PubMed revealed more than 250,000 entries on invertebrate models, which is comparatively higher than the previous year's reports (177,000). This indicates the efficiency of invertebrates as models in biomedical research. Significant discoveries were made using invertebrates ranging from embryonic development to aging. For example, Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode, possesses several advantages over the vertebrate model for biomedical research. For example, it has served as a model for the study of Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, Huntington's diseases, diabetes, cancer, and immune disorders, and the development of therapeutic agents for these diseases has a short generation time and inexpensive maintenance as its advantages.

{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nThen You Run appears to be a frenetic hybrid of Luther and The Hangover, with an added sprinkle of Scandi-noir bleakness \u2013 and four teenage girls as the lead characters. It follows four friends\u2019 misadventures (and then some) on what was supposed to be a brief holiday in Rotterdam, and the violent, unholy mess that emerges. This eight-parter is an enjoyably chaotic thriller that looks the business, and doesn\u2019t take its foot off the pedal for a second.\n\nIt begins in 2005, and, for the opening scene of each episode, it plays out like a particularly bleak mid-00s offshoot of The Killing. The deaths we witness are the work of a serial killer called The Traveller, who murders quite an astonishing amount of people, mostly in the middle of the night, in all manner of chilling scenarios: in snowbound traffic jams, roadside hotels, and on sleeper trains. So thank you to the writers for the additional travel anxiety that this leaves in its wake. How this is connected to the present day is not yet clear, but, as most of the people in the show are tearing around Europe in pursuit of enemies, drugs and\/or money, it is reasonable to assume that there is some kind of villainous connection reaching across the years. For now, though, these cold opens have got an urban legend horror movie feel to them, and it\u2019s nicely terrifying, if being mortally afraid of random massacres is the sort of thing you enjoy.\n\nThe first episode is largely concerned with our protagonists. Nessi, Ruth, Stink, and Tara are a close-knit group of friends who have just left school, though their plans to head straight to Zante are derailed when Tara\u2019s nan, and primary carer, dies unexpectedly. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they close the lid?\u201d hisses Stink (an outstanding Vivian Oparah from Rye Lane), showing her support only to discover that the Catholic funeral is an open casket affair. Tara is still 17, just about, and her mother is dead, so she has to go and live with her estranged father in Rotterdam instead of hitting the club 18-30 circuit with her mates. Her friends are appalled at this dereliction of duty. \u201cShe\u2019s the one who canceled summer!\u201d complains Stink, though naturally, it doesn\u2019t take long for the girls to get back together, especially when they find out that Tara\u2019s father lives in a lavish house and there\u2019s a beach, even if it is a small one.\n\nTheir scenes together are silly, funny, and often uproarious, and though the catastrophic events that unfold are hopefully not familiar to anyone at all, their rapport and banter is well done and believable. Each of them is a \u201ctype\u201d, from the boy-hungry one, the nerdy one, and the sensible one, to Tara, the catalyst, around whom all of the drama swirls.

However, rats deprived of sleep live for only about 3 weeks. They also develop abnormally low body temperatures and sores on their tails and paws. The sores probably develop because of the impairment of the rats' immune systems. In humans, it has been demonstrated that the metabolic activity of the brain decreases significantly after 24 hours of sustained wakefulness. Sleep deprivation results in a decrease in body temperature, a decrease in immune system function as measured by white blood cell count (the soldiers of the body), and a decrease in the release of growth hormone. Sleep deprivation can also cause increased heart rate variability. For our nervous systems to work properly, sleep is needed. Sleep deprivation makes a person drowsy and unable to concentrate the next day. It also leads to impairment of memory and physical performance and reduced ability to carry out mathematical calculations. If sleep deprivation continues, hallucinations and mood swings may develop.\nThe release of growth hormones in children and young adults takes place during deep sleep. Most cells of the body show increased production and reduced breakdown of proteins during deep sleep. Sleep helps humans maintain optimal emotional and social functioning while we are awake by giving rest during sleep to the parts of the brain that control emotions and social interactions. As mentioned earlier, sleep is a dynamic process. There are two distinct states that alternate in cycles and reflect differing levels of neuronal activity. Each state is characterized by a different type of brain wave (an electrical activity that is recorded with the help of electrodes placed on the skull) activity. Sleep consists of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and R sleep (rapid eye movement) The stages of NREM sleep and R or REM sleep cycle over and over again during a night's sleep. Stages I, II, III, and IV are followed by REM sleep. A complete sleep cycle, from the beginning of stage I to the end of REM sleep, usually takes about one and a half hours. For the purpose of analysis, a night's sleep is divided into three equal time periods: Sleep in the first third of the night, which comprises the highest percentage of NREM; sleep in the middle third of the night; and sleep in the last third of the night, the majority of which is REM.

From humble beginnings in Ancient Egypt to the sugary delights we know and love today, the life story of candy is just as interesting and exciting as it is delicious. Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the invention of candy to satisfy your curiosity and sweet tooth.\n\nThe History of Candy\nCandy has undergone a dramatic transformation to become the treat everyone knows and loves today. Your favorite goodies have taken on various forms over the years and probably looked and tasted very different from what you would expect now. People from different cultures and time periods used all kinds of ingredients and techniques to make unique versions of tasty candies.\n\nWhile many civilizations were developing their own kinds of sweets, experts are able to trace candy\u2019s origins back to its original invention. Let\u2019s take a look back in time and discover how modern candy came to be.\n\nAncient Origins\nMost historians credit ancient Egyptians with the invention of candy. As far back as 1500 BC, Egyptians created candy from any sweet, local ingredient they could find. They would often combine honey, nuts, and fruits to make a delicious treat that they could share with their community. Most experts believe that the taste was a coincidence and that candy\u2019s original purpose was to treat digestive ailments.\n\nHowever, ancient Egyptians weren\u2019t the only ones crafting tasty treats. Around the same time, other cultures were also making candy out of similar ingredients. Civilizations in China, India, and the Middle East also made these sweet snacks, and the Greeks and Romans jumped on the sugar train shortly after.\n\nA Brief Timeline\nAs time progressed, candy makers refined their creation process and started incorporating new ingredients into their recipes. Sugar candy became popular during the Middle Ages as a luxury for the upper class. When people perfected the sugar refining process, it became more widely available and eventually made its way to England and the Americas in the 17th century.\n\nCandy has experienced an explosion since then, taking on so many forms with different ingredients to satisfy anyone\u2019s craving. The first chocolate factory emerged in the 1700s, and the 1800s saw the invention of caramels and lollipops. The 19th century brought us early versions of modern candies we know and love today, introducing various flavored hard candies and delectable milk chocolates to the market.\n###\n\nSummarize the article in a short 5-8 bullet point list.

Billions upon billions would follow in its wake.\n\nGimbels was the first to sell a new kind of ink pen, the design of which had taken several decades to come to fruition. The pens, made by the Reynolds International Pen Company, promised an end to the messy mishaps users of fountain pens encountered \u2013 leaking ink, smudges and pooling ink blots.\n\nThe new ballpoint pens did away with this, using a special viscous ink which dried quickly and didn\u2019t leave smudges. At the heart of it, the rolling ball in the nib \u2013 and gravity \u2013 ensured a constant, steady stream of ink that didn\u2019t smear or leave solid pools of ink on the page.\n\nThe new ballpoint was clean and convenient. What it wasn\u2019t was cheap.\n\nThe new Reynolds ballpoint cost $12.50 \u2013 convert that to 2020 money and it\u2019s more than $180 (\u00a3138.50). Today, if you were buying your pens in bulk, from stack-\u2018em-high superstores, you could end up with more than 1,000 for the same price.\n\nThe pen was the first to go on sale in the US, but it was by no means the first ballpoint pen \u2013 the head of the US company that made it had in fact discovered a version during a business trip in South America. Its evolution is, in many ways, an example of a game-changing design waiting until outside factors \u2013 in this case the rise of plastics and mass-production infrastructure, and a brilliant marketeer \u2013 allowed it to achieve its full potential.\n\nLoud, then quiet\n\nThe creation of the ballpoint pen is usually credited to a Hungarian-Argentinian inventor L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00edr\u00f3, whose name inspired a catch-all term for modern ballpoints. But it is, in fact, a lot older.\n\nAn American, John J Loud, received the first patent for a ballpoint pen back in 1888. Loud, a lawyer and occasional inventor, wanted an ink pen which would be able to write on rougher materials such as wood and leather as well as paper. His masterstroke was the revolving steel ball, which was held in place by a socket. In his 1888 patent filing, he wrote:\n\n\u201cMy invention consists of an improved reservoir or fountain pen, especially useful, among other purposes, for marking on rough surfaces-such as wood, coarse wrapping-paper, and other articles where an ordinary pen could not be used.\u201d\n\nLoud\u2019s pen was indeed able to write on leather and wood, but it was too rough for paper. The device was deemed to have no commercial value and the patent eventually lapsed.\n\nVarious inventors tried to improve on Loud\u2019s design in the coming decade, but none were able to take it into production until B\u00edr\u00f3 in the 1930s. A journalist in Hungary, B\u00edr\u00f3 used fountain pens daily and was very familiar with their drawbacks.\n\n\u201cHe was used to the fountain pen which was very leaky and left ink on your hands and smudged and he was very frustrated by it,\u201d says Gemma Curtin, a curator at London\u2019s Design Museum.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nYou are a business marketing agent and want to advertise ballpoint pens.

{"prompt":"What is the principle of operation of a hydraulic ram pump, and what are some potential applications for this device?","chosen":"A hydraulic ram pump is a device that uses the energy of falling water to pump water from one location to another. The principle of operation is based on the principle of a hydraulic ram, which uses the energy of falling water to lift water to a higher elevation. A hydraulic ram pump consists of a pipe that is attached to a water source, such as a river or stream, and a water receiver, such as a tank or reservoir. When water flows through the pipe, it creates a vacuum at the downstream end, which draws water from the river or stream into the pipe. The water then flows through a valve and into the water receiver, where it is stored for later use.\n\nHydraulic ram pumps have a number of potential applications, including:\n\n1. Providing water for irrigation in remote or rural areas where there is no access to electricity or other sources of power.\n2. Supporting communities that rely on traditional water sources, such as rivers and streams, for their drinking water needs.\n3. Supporting emergency response efforts in the aftermath of natural disasters, such as earthquakes or hurricanes, when traditional water sources may be contaminated or inaccessible.\n4. Supporting sustainable development efforts, as hydraulic ram pumps require no external power source and can be easily maintained and repaired by local communities.","rejected":"The hydraulic ram pump is a device that uses the kinetic energy of a flowing river or stream to generate pressurized water for various applications. The basic principle of operation involves a piston-like mechanism that is driven by the flow of water through a narrow channel. As the water flows through the channel, it creates a pressure differential between the upstream and downstream sides of the piston, which causes it to move back and forth. This movement of the piston can be harnessed to generate electricity, pump water, or perform other tasks.\n\nHydraulic ram pumps have several potential applications, including irrigation, drinking water supply, and industrial processes. They are particularly useful in remote or rural areas where access to electricity or other forms of power may be limited. Additionally, they can be used to supplement existing water systems or as stand-alone systems in areas where there is a constant supply of flowing water.\n\nOne of the advantages of hydraulic ram pumps is their low maintenance requirements. They are typically constructed from durable materials such as metal or concrete, and require minimal upkeep to maintain their efficiency over time. Additionally, they are relatively inexpensive to install and operate, making them a cost-effective solution for many water-related applications.\n\nDespite these advantages, hydraulic ram pumps do have some limitations. They are not well-suited for applications where the flow rate of the water source is variable, as this can cause the pump to operate inefficiently or cease functioning altogether. Additionally, they may not be able to deliver large volumes of water over long distances, as the pressure generated by the pump decreases with distance from the source."}
{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nThe process of industrialization in the United States began to take off around the time of the Civil War. The rapid growth of the railroad across the nation, coupled with the increasing surpluses provided by mechanized agriculture, provided a base for the development of industry and the resultant rise of cities and the mass urban labor force. From around 1840 to the early 1950s, industry consistently grew as a portion of the American labor force, interrupted only by the Great Depression. To accommodate this industry, a wave of city building followed, adding growth to the old trading cities of the East such as Philadelphia and New York, and leading to the rise of new interior cities like Detroit, Chicago, and St. Louis. This process continued through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, stalling in the decade or so following the Second World War with the widespread growth of suburbs. City building in America has largely been in decline ever since.\n\nThe contours of the development of the US industrial base can be seen by tracing the development of the American machine tool industry. Machine tools are a good proxy for the overall robustness of an industrial ecosystem, as they form the base technical layer for much of heavy industry. In the United States, production of machine tools was scaled up during the Civil War, and by the 1880s high precision machine tools were being mass produced. Mass production continued to scale up through the Second World War, and technological innovation in the industry continued through the first decades of the Cold War\u2014but by the 1970s the industry in the U.S. was stagnant. Competitors in Germany, Japan and China dominated. For the purposes of this investigation, this developmental course can be read as a rough periodization of the rise and fall of American industrial capacity in general.\n\nThe United States became majority urban sometime between 1910 and 1920\u2014but American urbanization unfolded unevenly across space and time, generally spreading on the coattails of industry from the Northeast, then to the Midwest, then to the West, and finally to the South. Rail coverage followed this general pattern of spatial expansion, with mileage tripling between 1860 and 1880, and again between 1880 and 1920. The first states to become majority urban were Massachusetts and Rhode Island around 1850, and the Northeast as a whole became majority urban by 1880. Both the Midwest and the West became majority urban in the 1910s. As for the South, that region did not become majority urban until the 1950s, following its belated postwar industrialization (and the concomitant advent of air conditioning).\n\nIn American cities, flourishing industries provided masses of American workers with social mobility on a scale never before seen. After World War II, deals negotiated between labor and management institutionalized collective bargaining within the industrial sector, giving workers an unprecedented degree of economic security. Walter Reuther\u2019s Treaty of Detroit, negotiated in 1949 between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors, is a typical example of these arrangements. In exchange for protecting GM from annual strikes, it gave workers health coverage, retirement benefits, cost-of-living adjustments for wages, and guaranteed vacation time. For millions of Americans at this time, the American dream was in fact achievable.\n\nTo a large extent, this system of political economy subsidized many other parts of city life. It supported entire local business ecosystems, with small businesses catering to local workers. It supported a strong local tax base, which went to funding public infrastructure such as schools, parks, firefighting, and policing. And most importantly, it supported a dense and complex network of social capital, which allowed families, groups of friends, religious institutions, and voluntary institutions all to flourish and mediate community life. The industrial city was bustling and vibrant\u2014for example, in 1941, a streetcar ran every sixty seconds through the heart of Detroit.\n\nThis era is often romanticized, but its high level of social stability is indeed visible by certain measures: the homicide rate, for example, fell to its lowest-ever rate in the industrial era in 1935 as the system of political economy matured under New Deal reforms, and stayed there until the mid-1960s, when the dividends of deindustrialization started to come due en masse in America\u2019s cities.\n\nIndustrial capital also drove the physical development of America\u2019s cities to unforeseen heights, literally, financing the likes of the Chrysler Building even during the Great Depression. Every major U.S. city now has a cluster, sometimes a forest, of skyscrapers housing mostly service industries. Beyond cultural icons, though, the United States used its industrial surplus to invest in its infrastructure at the highest rate ever in its history, allowing cities to enjoy a well-functioning physical environment. In fact, America has not really built a city in this fashion since the beginning of deindustrialization. Newer cities such as Orlando or Las Vegas grew largely due to suburban sprawl\u2014not organized around urban life in any communal sense\u2014with large commuter populations who spend the vast majority of their lives outside of downtown.\n\nThe American urban landscape during peak industrialization, around the year 1950, reveals the context in which deindustrialization occurred. According to the 1950 Census, the top ten most populous cities in the U.S. at that time were, in order: New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, Washington D.C., and Boston. Since the previous census in 1940, all of these cities had registered consistent growth. The order of this list had shuffled around a bit in the intervening ten years, but its contents remained unchanged except for the replacement of Pittsburgh by Washington D.C., which had grown rapidly with the size of the federal government during the war.\n\nThis 1950 census is interesting as a snapshot of the American urban environment at its height, on the cusp of decline. Of these cities, all except Washington D.C. had grown on the back of industrialization. What\u2019s more, the population of each of these cities save for Los Angeles and New York peaked in this census and as of 2020 have never come close to their 1950s-era populations (New York for its part began a decades-long decline but eventually recovered its earlier numbers). In all of the cities that witnessed population decline besides Washington D.C., deindustrialization played a large part in this process.\n###\nWhat was negotiated in Walter Reuther's Treaty of Detroit in 1949?

Several factors could explain this trend, including a decrease in concerns about the Omicron coronavirus variant, the slowdown of Chinese factory-gate inflation, and positive news about early studies on the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. Additionally, the People's Bank of China's recent easing measures have boosted risk-on sentiment in the country, potentially supporting the weaker dollar and the yuan's appreciation. However, it is important to note that currency and equity markets are complex and can be influenced by a variety of factors, including global economic conditions, political developments, and investor sentiment.","rejected":"The recent movements in Asian currencies and equities can be attributed to a combination of factors, including market sentiment, economic data, and global events. Here are some possible reasons:\n\nMarket sentiment: Risk-on sentiment has been prevailing in the markets recently, with investors becoming more confident about the economic outlook amid signs of a slowdown in the spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19. This has led to an increase in risk appetite, which has boosted equity prices and weakened the dollar.\n\nEconomic data: Positive economic data from China, such as a rise in manufacturing activity and a slowdown in inflation, has boosted market sentiment and supported the Chinese yuan. Similarly, stronger-than-expected GDP growth in Indonesia has supported the Indonesian rupiah.\n\nGlobal events: Geopolitical tensions, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, have had an impact on market sentiment and currencies. For example, the Ukrainian hryvnia has been under pressure due to the ongoing tensions.\n\nOverall, the recent movements in Asian currencies and equities reflect a combination of market sentiment, economic data, and global events."}

{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nIn order to find a little relief they end up resorting to methods which do them even more harm. The most widespread of these are alcohol, cigarettes and drugs. Their psychological state is so seriously disturbed and deep-rooted that they do not hesitate to use substances which harm their bodies and damage their internal organs. As a result of the endless unhappiness of their existence, they bury their heads in the sand and abandon the natural intelligence which they would normally regard as their main asset. Hence, they fail to acknowledge that all these things will only worsen the situation they are in.\n\nIt is impossible for a person who lives continually in such a psychological state to be robust and healthy. His body will age faster than normal and will signal this in various ways. Ailments starting with continual headaches, early hair loss and lack of appetite are the forerunners of more painful and serious illnesses which will emerge later. Their health, which is amongst the most important gifts we have as far as happiness is concerned, is dangerously undermined by the constant stress which pervades their lives. They are not even aware that their misguided efforts to ease their troubles a little are only opening the way to even greater danger, together with all of its consequences.\n\nBelievers are able to enjoy the peace of sincere reliance on Allah and taking only Him as their friend and guardian. They never behave in any way which will endanger their health which they regard as a blessing given them by Allah. As a result, they look after themselves to the best of their ability and so remain robust and healthy. They know what an important and wonderful thing health is and they are always grateful to Allah for it. They do not ignore every problem they encounter like the disbelievers but concern themselves with it right away and take precautions against complications which may arise later.\n\nIn return for this steadfastness on the part of the believers and their heartfelt devotion to Him, Allah rewards them with a beautiful life in this world. Of course, \"beautiful life\" refers to both the material and the spiritual. The spiritual happiness they feel is the greatest reason for their looking healthy and attractive. The beauty possessed by believers is the light which Allah gives them. Because of this light, the faces of believers are always open and clear. With the light which Allah gives believers He makes them different from and superior to disbelievers and provides them with a spiritual beauty and a striking air of faith. Allah describes the expression of faith on the faces of the believers and the impact it will have on those around them, **\"... Their mark is on their faces, the traces of prostration...\"** (Surat al-Fath: 29)\n\nJust as it exists in the life of this world, so this difference between deniers of the faith and the believers will also emerge on the Day of Judgment. Allah informs us of this in the following verses:\n\nFaces that Day will be radiant, gazing at their Lord. And faces that Day will be glowering, realizing that a back-breaking blow has fallen. (Surat al-Qiyama: 22-25)\n\nThat Day some faces will be radiant, laughing, rejoicing. That Day some faces will be dust-covered, overcast with gloom. Those are the dissolute disbelievers.\n\"\"\"\nWho is this text intended for?","chosen":"This text is intended for anyone who is seeking to find relief from the stresses of life.

I'm so sorry there was no one here to let you in. I told my flatmates to let you in if they saw you, but they are nowhere to be found today. As usual, really.'\n\nMatt shook his head.\n\n'Hey, don't worry. We parked the van outside here, and went off exploring on foot. Actually the directions you gave me were really good.

We have one of the most important unis in the country down here. The place is absolutely flooded with students. Good for me, it makes it easy to keep a steady flow of students coming through the house.

It's a good old New Zealand, well-built abode.'\n\nFelicity sighed.\n\n'It looks good, I agree, but actually, unfortunately, it's got a lot of issues. The plumbing sucks, and there's plenty of rot as well, hidden away in the walls. These old houses all have problems, but it was all I could afford. Eventually I'm gonna have to find some money to fix it up.'\n\n'Hey, listen, all in all you are really doing well.' replied Matt. 'You've bought your own place, your job seems to be going well.

{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nA degreaser is a cleaner designed to remove grease, oils, cutting fluids, corrosion inhibitors, handling soils, fingerprints, and other contamination common in assembly, stamping, and other metal fabrication in refineries, motor repair shops, airplane hangars, factories, etc... Degreasers go by a number of different names including precision cleaner, maintenance cleaner, as well as several specific for automotive repairs such as carb cleaner or brake cleaner. The objective of a degreaser is to remove the offending soil quickly, avoiding as much wiping and scrubbing as possible. Degreasing solvents are commonly packaged as an aerosol for convenience. Aerosols have the added advantage of providing a forceful spray that creates agitation and which penetrates small crevices.\nWater-based degreasers are common in a trigger sprayer, or in gallon or drum containers for immersion or batch system cleaning. Specialized equipment like ultrasonic or vapor degreasers are available for more automated cleaning. These processes are repeatable, so better suited for more critical cleaning applications, like aerospace or medical appliance maintenance. Techspray offers a large selection of degreasers and maintenance cleaners under the G3\u00ae, E-LINE\u2122, PWR-4\u2122, and Precision-V brands, which range from economical heavy-industry cleaners to high-precision solvents for sensitive components. Dust, dirt, grease, and oxidation contamination can cause corrosion, slipping hazards, overheating, increased electrical resistance in contact areas, and many other issues. Degreasing may be required to prep for downstream processes like painting or plating. Cleaner Degreasers can clean oil, grease, oxides, and handling contamination from equipment and assemblies that include:\nMetal and fiber optic cable splices\nMotors and transformers\nProgrammable Logic Controllers (PLCs)\nPneumatic and hydraulic assemblies\nElectronics and electrical equipment\nMeters\/measurement devices\nIndustrial-strength degreasers are needed to remove grease, tar, asphalt, oil, and grime in these kinds of applications: Clutches, armatures, generators, compressors, electrical motors and equipment\nBearings, chains, cables, pulleys, and gear drives\nBrakes, springs, and flywheels.\nDegreasers are intended to remove oil, grease, oxides, and handling contamination from equipment and assemblies, while a contact cleaner does the same thing specifically for electrical contacts.\nA contact cleaner (also called electrical cleaner, switch cleaner, electrical contact cleaner, and (specific for automotive repair) battery terminal cleaner removes contamination from electrical contacts, the conductive surfaces of connectors, switches, and other electrical and electronic components with moving surface contacts.\nThere are several factors that can have a big impact on performance and safety in choosing the proper degreaser for a given application in an environment:\nFlammability \u2013 Degreasers often contain very flammable alcohols and hydrocarbon solvents. They can be cheap and effective, but can be dangerous without proper ventilation, or around open flames, sparks (e.g. from welding), or hot surfaces. Nonflammable degreasers avoid these safety issues but are generally more expensive. In addition, some non-flammable cleaners can be very toxic, containing hazardous solvents like Perchloroethylene, trichloroethylene, or n-propyl bromide. High flashpoint (often called \u201chigh flash\u201d) solvents have vapors that are less likely to combust in normal ambient temperatures (say below 140\u00b0F\/60\u00b0C).\nDielectric strength \u2013 If you plan to work on powered equipment, or need to switch it on before the solvent has flashed off, consider a degreaser with a high dielectric strength.  Make sure you know the amperage and voltage of the circuits you are trying to clean before spraying anything onto the circuits and evaluate the suitability of any cleaner in your application. Dielectric strength is the maximum electric field that the material can withstand before its insulating properties break down. The lower the dielectric strength, the more likely it will break down and allow electricity to flow through and short out.\nPlastic \/ rubber compatibility \u2013 Care needs to be taken when cleaning plastic or components, rubber gaskets, and seals. If the degreaser is incompatible with the plastic, it can craze (create small cracks), embrittle, or soften the material. Rubber seals may swell, shrink, or dissolve. A new degreaser should always be tested before being used broadly. Toxicity \u2013 N-Propyl Bromide (nPB), Trichloroethylene (TCE), and Perchloroethylene (Perc) are highly toxic chemicals commonly used in degreasers to provide cleaning performance in a nonflammable formula. There are documented court cases where workers suffered major health effects when exposed to high levels of these chemicals. Workers reported headaches, dizziness, and even loss of full body control. There are also possible links to reproductive problems and cancer. All of this has caused maintenance facilities to reconsider their solvent choices, especially with manual cleaning when exposure tends to be higher. Environmental issues \u2013 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), solvents that add to smog, or solvents with high global warming potential (GWP) have been a focus of regulators. Some state (e.g. CARB, the California Air Review Board), municipal, and even industry-specific regulations restrict the use of high VOC or high GWP materials.It is common to clean grease and oil off of parts at a benchtop, workstation, or in the field, which generally requires a manual cleaning method. Manual cleaning methods are more labor-intensive and less repeatable, so results vary from operator to operator. Aerosol \u2013 Aerosol packaging is a sealed system, which ensures \nfresh solvent.

{"prompt":"The following information may be useful:\n<start of reference>\nCorey Schwab (born November 4, 1970) is a former Canadian professional ice hockey goalie. He was drafted in the 10th round, 200th overall in the 1990 NHL Entry Draft by the New Jersey Devils. Schwab won the 2003 Stanley Cup with the New Jersey Devils and the 1995 Calder Cup with the Albany River Rats.\n\nPlaying career\nFollowing a three-year WHL career in Seattle, Schwab saw time with the ECHL's Cincinnati Cyclones and the AHL's Utica Devils before settling in with the AHL's Albany River Rats for two seasons. During the 1994-95 season, Schwab was joined by fellow 1990 draftee Mike Dunham between the pipes. While Schwab led the league in goals against average with 2.59, the two combined for the AHL's fewest goals against and were awarded the Harry \"Hap\" Holmes Memorial Trophy as well as the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy as the playoff MVP's helping the River Rats capture their first Calder Cup title.\n\nThe next season, Schwab saw his first action in the NHL when he was called up to New Jersey where he appeared in ten games. At the end of the season, he was traded to the Tampa Bay Lightning, where he stayed for three seasons. He then went out West to the Vancouver Canucks for another brief stay and spent time that year with the AHL's Syracuse Crunch and IHL's Orlando Solar Bears before moving on to play with the IHL's Kansas City Blades in 2000-01.\n\nSchwab began the 2001-02 season at the Toronto Maple Leafs' training camp without a contract. After an impressive pre-season, he was signed to the team as the backup goaltender for Curtis Joseph. Schwab started 30 games for the Leafs and had a career high 12 wins before signing as a free agent in the off-season with the team that originally drafted him back in 1990, the New Jersey Devils.\n\nThe return to New Jersey was very timely for Schwab, as the Devils claimed the Stanley Cup in 2003 - the franchise's third title in nine years and Schwab's first as a player.\n\nSchwab's final game was played on January 17, 2004 where he posted a 2\u20131 overtime victory over the Washington Capitals. Schwab finished his career having played in 147 regular season NHL games amassing 43 wins, 63 losses and 13 ties with a goals against average of 2.89, a save percentage of .896, and 6 shutouts. Schwab appeared in 40 minutes of postseason action over 3 games with the Maple Leafs and Devils stopping all 13 shots he faced.\n\nHe served as goaltending development coach and scout for three seasons (2005\u201308) with the Tampa Bay Lightning.

Their din was no match for light lancing through leaves of madrone trees lining the Paseo then flashing off glossy black Maybachs skidding round a plaza like a monarch fleeing the paparazzi. Your voice skipped and paused like a pencil. Layers of morning pastries flaked gingerly then fell, soft as vowels, on a china plate. One learns to cherish the wizened reserve of old world manners, two blotched hands making wings of a daily paper beside us between sips of caf con leche, a demeanor in short gentle as grand edifaces along this boulevard. Yet Guernicais down the street, and some windshields wear a sinister face, sometimes two. Think Goya. Just south of here, on the lower slopes of the Sierras, fields of olive groves braid the land like a Moorish head, but those sultans were kicked out long ago. In the lobby of the Hotel Urban, I wait for a cab, my obedient rolling bag like a pet beside me. I have loved again another city but Madrid is yours: her caped ols, her bullish flag, her glass pavilions and outdoor tables like a festival of unbroken laughter, our dark harbors, finding level. ii. Salobrea That stretch of mountains features white windmill blades whose slow turns are rifles aiming, for I cannot help but think of Lorca's killing between here and the village Alfaar, and the firing squad's gun pops are that Flamencan dancer's heel stomps. I bring back, too, her brisk hand claps and the cantor's Andalusian moans like dried sticks, or bones crumbling in his throat. Only souvenir shops and steep winding streets accrete in this region's stacked brochures. Her dress spills across the restaurant's floor like a red shadow, darker than billboards of black bulls high above roadways, motionless but seeming to gallop like Franco's brigades. All seeing is an act of war. Tanks and artillery or Spanish castles and mosques? I choose to lose, and beneath a watercolorist's sky study Didi's splendor, nude against the unruffled backdrop of the Alboran Sea whose waves match my sighs and bomb this beach, launching sprays of white duds. iii. Crdoba, Mezquita Even if he'd pulled over to study Andalusia's road signs, after one thousand and one nights, he still could not make out its calligraphic script, its vertical lines, its dots, marks like smoke stilled from incense, its curled sand soft Arabic, but this city's voice has coffins and carnations, and its hoarse singing shoots through him like twelve bars of earthen road that lengthens into a labyrinth of knowing blood beneath black skin. More echoes: the Alhambra sent him back to the seraglio of his youth where a Moorish guard stood in a museum, unfazed by a harem's rising laughter behind palace doors. Here are pillars and banded arches to once again imagine the body passing through like a key into infinity. Was this the answer to his ghetto past? But why travel so far? Since a child, even in sleep, he voyaged and broke free, tossing dice in dreams, once below deck on a caravel next to grains of paradise. He's collecting a thousand faces. He's moving beneath eyelids, turning time into flesh. Don't judge him. The courtyard's orange trees where once he washed like a morisco are teaching his tongue the craft.\n###\nSummarize the key themes and motifs of the text in at least 5 sentences for an audience of high school students.","chosen":"The text is a collection of three poems, each with its own unique themes and motifs.

{"prompt":"Consider this reference information delimited in \"\"\":\n\"\"\"\nIt was only afterwards Ray came over and told us how Ed had died while we were away, and so we were feeling a bit peevish for having taken Thelma's D27 Desiccator. It kind of felt like we were taking advantage of another person's misfortunes.\n\nWell it makes you stop and really have yourself a think when you hear how someone practically your own age has gone and died all of a sudden. For a while there, Norm and I wondered what it might've been that Ed died of, but seein' as we didn't really know, Norm moved on to talking about the D27 Desiccator. According to Norm, it was a top of the line model, just the very thing we needed to suck the moisture out of stuff. It's always been so damp and mildewy in the basement. You can't ever really store old clothes or books down there on account of the spots that grow on the fabric and the paper, and it sure is useless tryna dry clothes on a rack down there. Come back even a week later and they're still damp, only now they smell. So Norm was just raving about the machine, calling it a marvel of modern engineering, so efficient it'd suck water from a chunk of granite.\n\nNorm plugged in the dehumidifier and got it going. \"Works just tickety-boo,\" he said, and we wondered why Thelma'd want to get rid of a perfectly good D27 Desiccator. We felt guilty for a bit, then got to work washing dirty laundry from the trip. While the laundry was going, Norm did the lawn and I went across the road to pay my respects and to drop off a bunch of single serving lasagnas I'd thrown together.\n\nPoor Thelma! She didn't talk much, and none at all about her Ed, how he was dead, or even the circumstances of his dying. I tried to get her to talk about how Ed died, partly because I was curious but partly too because they say it's good to talk things through. But all Thelma could say about it was that it was too horrible to tell. Mostly she just sat there in the front room staring out the window sometimes muttering something about needing to wash dishes or sometimes humming a snatch from a favourite song that maybe she and Ed had once heard on the radio years before. I'm not always patient about such things. I tried my best to bide the silences between her random comments and old songs, but pretty soon my patience had all dried up and I was itching to get back across the road to finish cleaning after our vacation.\n\nWhen I'd left for Thelma's, Norm had been cutting the lawn, but when I came back, Norm wasn't outside anymore. Going inside, I called his name again and again but there was no answer. Norm's funny that way, getting preoccupied with one thing and another and wandering off. I've always suspected he's a little bit ADHD\u2014always starting something, then getting distracted when he's halfway through. Well, I couldn't find Norm anywhere, so I went downstairs to hang up another load of laundry. I filled up the basket with Norm's old underwear and work shirts, then set out another clothes rack by the new dehumidifier. That's when I noticed\u2014there on the floor by the D27 Desiccator\u2014a mound of dust or ashes or grit or something\u2014just a dried up old heap of dirt. \"Damn!\" I thought to myself, \"but it's well nigh impossible to keep a house clean with Norm living in it. He's been here tinkering with the dehumidifier again and left himself a pile of dirt.\"\n\nI went and pulled out the broom and dustpan and set to cleaning up Norm's little mess. I had to kneel to get at all the bits of grit, and there, closer to the concrete floor, light from the window well came in at just the right angle and caught the glint of something nestled in the dirt. I brushed away some of the flecks, maybe the way an archeologist might clean up around an excavation, and plopped in the middle of the mound was Norm's wedding ring. \"Damn it, Norm!\" I muttered. The man would lose his own head if it weren't firmly attached to his neck. I picked up the ring and stuffed it in my pocket for safekeeping, but when I did that, the motion shuffled around some of the dirt. There, underneath the first layer, was another glint of gold, something maybe the same size as the end of my pinky. I held it to the light for a closer look. Why, it was Norm's gold tooth. \"Norm!\" I shouted. \"What have you gone and done?\" I scattered the dust some more and found other bits of metal\u2014the rims of his reading glasses, his silver belt buckle, a few coins that he liked to clink around in his left pocket, the car keys. \"Norm!\" I screamed.\n\"\"\"\n\nWhat is the significance of the strange events described in the text?","chosen":"The strange events described in the text, such as the disappearance of Norm's wedding ring and the discovery of his gold tooth scattered in the dirt, are significant because they hint at a deeper, more sinister truth underlying the surface narrative. The text creates an atmosphere of mystery and tension, leaving the reader to wonder what really happened to Ed and why Thelma is so grief-stricken that she can only hum songs and mutter about dishes. The discovery of Norm's wedding ring and gold tooth in the dirt suggests that something sinister may have occurred, and the author's use of language and tone create a sense of unease and foreboding that builds to a dramatic climax.","rejected":"The strange events described in the text are significant because they show how a seemingly ordinary event, like borrowing a friend's desiccator, can have unexpected and far-reaching consequences.

{"prompt":"Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nSuddenly, his other leg twitches at the knee. The belt is registering more power. Disconnecting one of the legs gave the other more time. He lifts that leg easily out of the water and finds himself at the bottom of a narrow stairwell. The railing looks more like a sculpture. It goes up and down and splits and converges, but it is still a railing, and it will help him up the stairs. A single lantern at the top illuminates the steps. Water trickles down, feeding algae and moss. Spider webs span the stairwell making it obvious that these stairs have been abandoned.\n\n\"This is better than being speared by one of those hooks _,_ \" Allan mutters. He uses his working leg to step up, dragging the leg that doesn't work behind him. The crazy railing is sturdy, and it braces him. One step at a time, Allan ascends.\n\nWhen he gets to the spider web, Allan looks around. The web is thick. Water drops that hang on its silky thread reflect the light and bend it making the drops look like diamonds. The spider crawls out from under the ornate metal hand railing. It's larger than his fist and has thin legs three times its body length. Its little eyes look at Allan and study him.\n\n\"Come on! Get outta my way!\" Allan blurts out. His voice echoes in the narrow stairwell. Responding to Allan's obvious advantages, it scuttles back into the shadow of the railing. Allan takes off the jacket he'd stolen and throws it over the web, knocking it down. He continues upward. The stars become visible, and there are only about three stories more to go. Every time he lifts the unusable leg he wants to scream out. His arm shakes and his lower back throbs. _Keep going, just keep going._\n\nAt the top, the fresh air fills his lungs. He's conquered the steps and is now on the roof of one of the tallest buildings. He can see most of Dantia and it is big. Hundreds of tall buildings line the horizon. They are intermingled with smaller ones, pointy ones, and some very crooked ones. Lights fill some windows, but most are dark. Allan hobbles to the edge of the roof. He can see the intersection three blocks away where he ditched the authorities. Spotlights illuminate the roads as they search desperately for Allan.\n\nThen, as if prompted by some twisted cue, his good leg dies. He crumples onto the roof of the building. Allan's brain feels like a beaten lump of play dough. It occurs to him how impossible it will be to find Mizzi. He couldn't read his map at the mushroom forest, and now he's so far from where he should be that Mizzi won't be able to find _him_. This city is not handicapped accessible, and maybe he should have stayed in the water where it was easier to move.\n\nAllan takes the pin-up girl pin from his pocket. When his uncle gave it to him, it had reminded him of his father. But as he touches the smooth surface, it reminds him of Rubic. Tears come to his eyes. He doesn't want Rubic to die. He did all he could to get back to him, to get help, but he has failed. Now Rubic continues to suffer because of him. _Why am I being punished?_\n\nAllan listens to the night. All he hears is the drip of the water that runs off him. He wants to sleep, rest up, and then seek an answer. He takes the glowing snail out of his pocket. It's as bright as ever. He sets it down and watches it slowly make its way down the steps. \"You've got a long way to go, but thanks for the help.\"\n\nSome time later, Allan awakes to a loud thunk. He's heard that noise before. He looks up and sees Asantia's airship hovering over him. Her tow cable anchors her ship to the roof. A small door opens on the bottom of the craft and down slides Asantia on her automatic handles. She stops just above the roof and then hops down the rest of the way.\n\nAllan moans and rolls his eyes. His luck has indeed dried up. There's not an ounce of fight left in him. \"Just take me. Put me up for auction, put a collar on me or sell me for new blimp parts. I can't take anymore!\" he cries. Asantia bends over him and smiles, her face more pleasant than before. He's taken by surprise when she holds his hand and says, \"Enough with the drama. I've come to help.\"\n\n\"What? Why?\"\n\n\"Because you helped me.\" Asantia wears a leather vest that buttons up the sides and is stitched together from odd shaped pieces. Her pants are black and have cargo pockets below the knee bulging with who-knows-what. A large blade is strapped to her back with the handle sticking up. Allan takes her hand. She tries to lift him but fails. He collapses back onto the roof. \"Oh, I'm not going anywhere, just leave me. No one can help me.\"\n\n\"Okay, let's cut those metal legs off.\n###\n\nFrom the text, extract the man's previous journey and how he got there. Include the man's thoughts on Mizzi and Rubic.

Its height is , just below the  height limit in force in Melbourne at the time. Economic considerations may also have influenced the design, as this created maximum floor area at more commercially attractive lower levels, and a cheaper construction method for higher floors.  Norris incorporated faience into many of his building exteriors, notably the G.J. Coles building, but this is absent from Deva House and there is no surviving evidence that it was part of the original finish.\n\nArchitecture academic Philip Goad has suggested that a first classification would place Deva House within the Palazzo style, with Greek Revival details in its facade treatment, but he adds that closer analysis reveals a more streamlined approach, with elements of Eclecticism.\n\nThe building today \nAs with most period buildings on Bourke Street, modernisation of Deva House has left little more than the shell of its original design. The interior of Deva House from the second floor up has been entirely gutted and rebuilt as a hotel, while both the ground floor facade and interior have been stripped out in their entirety and rebuilt in the contemporary high-street style and now house shops.

{"prompt":"Reference:\nAtavistic regression is a hypnosis-related concept introduced by the Australian scholar and psychiatrist Ainslie Meares. Meares coined his term from the English atavism, which is derived from the Latin atavus, meaning a great-grandfather's grandfather and, thus, more generally, an ancestor.\n\nAs used by Meares, for example, his 1960 work A System of Medical Hypnosis, the term \"atavistic regression\" is used to denote the tendency to revert to ancestral type:\n \"The atavistic hypothesis requires\u2026 a regression from normal adult mental function at an intellectual, logical level, to an archaic level of mental function in which the process of suggestion determines the acceptance of ideas. This regression is considered to be the basic mechanism in the production of hypnosis.\"\n\nMeares held the view that when in hypnosis, the higher (more evolved) functions of the subject's brain were switched off, and the subject reverted to a far more archaic and far less advanced (in evolutionary terms) mental state; something which significantly altered the subjects' cognitive processing so that they readily accepted internally consistent, literal logic without any of the normal filters and verifications against the objective facts of the real world.\n\nLater, Meares came to believe that it was the atavistic regression rather than the treatments that went with hypnosis that helped the patient. He concluded that the regression enabled the mind to rest and restored its equilibrium in a way that was analogous to sleep. On one hand people who did not spontaneously undergo this process became tense and unable to let their guard down. On the other hand, helping people to learn how to experience this state a couple of times a day seemed to facilitate mental coping which Meares believed was due to sufficient mental rest.\n\nBy this time he had completed a transition from hypnosis in which he took a large role to the smaller role of facilitator showing patients how to induce this state themselves. He referred to this regressed state by different names at different times  e.g.: relaxing meditative experience, relaxing mental exercise, deep relaxation, atavistic regression, mental ataraxis. Contemporary teachers of his method may refer to this as Stillness Meditation or Stillness Meditation Therapy, although some use other terms. Some other traditions use the term stillness meditation and these unrelated systems have little in common with Meares' method.\n\nNotes\n\nInstruction:\nFrom the text, extract the method of inducing this state of hypnosis.","chosen":"Meares held the view that when in hypnosis, the higher (more evolved) functions of the subject's brain were switched off, and the subject reverted to a far more archaic and far less advanced (in evolutionary terms) mental state; something which significantly altered the subjects' cognitive processing so that they readily accepted internally consistent, literal logic without any of the normal filters and verifications against the objective facts of the real world.","rejected":"\"He referred to this regressed state by different names at different times e.g.: relaxing meditative experience, relaxing mental exercise, deep relaxation, atavistic regression, mental ataraxis.\""}
{"prompt":"Read this for context:\n<start of reference>\nCharter schools, contract schools, and vouchers are discussed in terms of influencing the administrative aspect of curriculum and less in terms of academic prowess. Multicultural education is viewed in terms of celebrating the customs, traditions, and cultures of the various countries represented within a school along with the language policy a school imposes that dictates the degree a foreign language is to be used within the learning environment. Addressing multicultural education, various forms of assessment \u2013 formative and standardized testing \u2013 are recommended, emphasizing the necessity of teachers and learners adapting instruction and learning tactics throughout the entire learning progression.\n\nThe philosophical and ideological influences on the development and implementation of curriculum vary among stakeholders. From a philosophical base, the curriculum should answer the following questions: \"What is the meaning and purpose of education? Why and how do teachers educate people? What difference does education make for individuals and for society?\" (Gutek, 2004, p. 2) Taking these same questions from an ideological perspective thus creates more of a varied notion of education and how it is to be implemented, now from the viewpoint of individual groups of a collective society that are bound by time and space. Indeed, stakeholders want the best for learners, but the way in which the learner is to be educated will be influenced by the sociocultural background and political views of a particular group.\n\nConservatism as an ideology generates strong opinion for school choice. Charter, contract, and distance learning schools, for example, often take on a \"business-like\" approach to education in giving parents a choice as to where to educate their children. That is, schools compete based on the economic principles of supply and demand. Charter and contract schools receive funds from the government as do public schools although they differ in how they administer these funds (Ornstein and Hunkins, 2009). To create a comparative advantage, charter and contract schools have more freedom in hiring teachers and investing in infrastructure in ways that create more of a demand for new enrollees. A voucher system is another way that schools use government funding for attracting new students, although there is political debate as to its effectiveness. In a Washington D.C. school, the following occurred: more than 17,000 children...received scholarships [or vouchers] to attend participating private schools...The U.S. Department, based on concerns from Congress that there was little local support, decided \u2013 after the students were accepted \u2013 to only allow existing scholarship recipients to continue to participate (Alliance for school choice..., 2009). Although voucher or scholarship systems can attract students to certain schools they may not have had the opportunity to attend, it usually is at the expense of public education.\n\nThe multicultural school of today contains a wide variety of students that make up a diverse student body.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nFrom the text given, extract the different ideologies and philosophies that are used to influence the curriculum and education of students in the US.

{"prompt":"The following information may be useful:\n<start of reference>\nBonus depreciation in real estate can be a powerful tool for an investor to use to significantly reduce taxable net income.\n\nIn this article, we\u2019ll take an in-depth look at real estate bonus depreciation, including an example of how to use bonus depreciation to reduce pre-tax income.\n\nBefore we talk about bonus depreciation, let\u2019s begin with a quick review of real estate depreciation in general. \n\nAs IRS Publication 946 explains, depreciation is an allowance real estate investors receive for property wear and tear, deterioration, or obsolescence. A real estate investor may use an annual depreciation deduction from pre-tax income to recover the cost basis of a property over the time an investor owns a property. \n\nMost types of tangible property such as real estate (excluding the land value), furniture, flooring, appliances, and landscape improvements can be depreciated. \n\nHowever, a property must meet the following requirements to be depreciable:\n\nProperty must be owned by a taxpayer rather than rented\nProperty must be used for business or investment purposes\nProperty must have a determinable useful life\nProperty must have an expected useful life of more than 1 year.\n\nResidential real estate used for investment purposes can be depreciated over a period of 27.5 years. If a single-family rental home has a value of $110,000 (excluding the land), the annual depreciation expense would be $4,000. \n\nSome items within a home can also be depreciated over a shorter period of time. For example, the IRS allows appliances and carpeting to be depreciated over a period of 5 years. \n\nIf an investor spends $10,000 to buy new kitchen appliances and carpeting for the bedrooms, the depreciation expense would be $2,000 for the next 5 years.\n\nThe declining balance system for depreciation allows an investor to depreciate assets based on their remaining useful life. As the name suggests, larger depreciation deductions may be taken initially, and as the balance declines the depreciation expense goes down as well. \n\nIRS Publication 527, Residential Rental Property, provides an in-depth explanation of the declining balance depreciation system for rental real estate.\n\nThe third type of depreciation in real estate is bonus depreciation that allows a taxpayer to deduct some of an item\u2019s cost in the first year. \n\nMany real estate investors may be unaware of this depreciation tax deduction that expires in a few years. So, in the rest of this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at bonus depreciation in real estate and how it works.\n\nIt\u2019s important to note that bonus depreciation in real estate applies only to improvements and not to a rental property itself. \n\nThat\u2019s because real estate has a useful life of more than 20 years. Residential rental property is depreciated over 27.5 years, while commercial real estate is depreciated over a period of 39 years.\n\nThe 100% bonus depreciation in real estate only lasted until the end of the 2022 tax year. \n\nBonus depreciation and the Section 179 deduction are 2 different types of deductions. \n\nWhile bonus depreciation is used to expense improvements to a rental property, Section 179 of the IRS tax code allows an investor to deduct the purchase price of equipment such as autos, office equipment, or computers, subject to certain limitations.\n\nUnlike a Section 179 deduction, bonus depreciation is:\n\nNot limited to an annual dollar amount.\nNot limited to the annual profit of a business.\nItem does not need to be used more than 50% of the time for business.\n\nIn other words, bonus depreciation can be claimed even if a business is not turning a profit. For real estate investors, that can be an important distinction, because sometimes a rental property depreciation expense can significantly reduce or even eliminate taxable net income.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nIn a bullet point format of 3 sentences, explain how bonus depreciation can affect the real estate business and parties interested in investing in property.","chosen":"*Bonus depreciation can significantly reduce taxable net income for real estate investors.\n*The declining balance system for depreciation allows larger depreciation deductions initially.\n*Bonus depreciation and the Section 179 deduction are two different types of deductions.","rejected":"The text explained that a business would be able to take the cost of the purchase of the real estate, as well as any improvements made, and depreciate the cost over a period of time. If a business were to buy real estate and immediately put a large amount of money into it for renovations, it would be able to depreciate that amount over a period of time. In the event that the business were to lose money, the depreciation expense could be high enough to wipe out the loss, thus helping the business. The high tax deduction is beneficial to any business looking to buy real estate and make improvements to the building."}

{"prompt":"What are the key components of an airbag system in a vehicle, and how does it work to protect occupants in a collision?","chosen":"Airbags are a critical safety feature in modern vehicles, designed to deploy during a collision and protect the vehicle's occupants. The key components of an airbag system include the airbag module, sensors, control unit, and the airbag itself.\n\nThe airbag module is the central component of the system, containing the airbag and all the necessary hardware to deploy it. The sensors are responsible for detecting a collision and sending a signal to the control unit, which then calculates the appropriate deployment parameters based on the severity of the impact. The control unit triggers the release of a small amount of gas from the airbag module, which rapidly inflates the airbag and deploys it in front of the occupant.\n\nAirbags are typically made of a nylon or polyester fabric and are designed to deploy at high speeds, providing a cushion between the occupant and the vehicle's hard structures. The deployment speed and force are carefully calibrated to provide optimal protection for the occupant without causing additional harm.\n\nIn addition to the airbag itself, other components of the system may include additional sensors, such as those that detect rollovers or side impacts, as well as seat belt pretensioners that tighten the seat belts to secure the occupant during deployment. Overall, the airbag system is an important safety feature designed to minimize injury to vehicle occupants during a collision.","rejected":"The key components of an airbag system in a vehicle include sensors that detect the force of a collision, an electronic control unit (ECU) that analyzes the sensor data and triggers the deployment of the airbags, and the airbags themselves, which are made of a special fabric that quickly inflates when the ECU sends an electrical current to release stored gas. The airbags are designed to deploy at specific angles and locations to protect the head, chest, and hips of the vehicle's occupants, depending on the severity and direction of the impact. The entire system is calibrated and tested to ensure proper deployment and function in the event of a collision."}

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nFor each digital asset you offer behind a landing page form, design and set up the leads nurturing workflow that should be started when the form is submitted. Ideally, each landing page form should have its own email workflow that is optimized to increase the interest level of a lead who downloaded that digital asset. The leads nurturing workflow could for example look like this:\n\nMarketing automation systems support designing workflows that can contain if...then...else logic. For example, you can design a workflow that does different things depending on how the lead reacts to your leads nurturing emails. If an email is not opened, you can send a reminder some days later. If an email contains two call-to-action buttons, the workflow can adapt its remaining behavior based on which one was clicked.\n\n## Proactive leads nurturing\n\nMass mailshots are not dead yet. In fact, they can be highly effective if done properly. They allow you to communicate product or company news, offers, or discount campaigns as needed. However, if done wrong they are a big turn-off for many people. In particular, monthly newsletters may not be the best way. Read the next section for more details on newsletter emails.\n\nThe trick is to send your mailshots to better-segmented address lists, such that you send only relevant information to certain groups of your leads database. It is unlikely the same email sent to all your leads will feel equally relevant to all of them. Doing that only makes you appear spammy and does nothing to help increase the engagement level.\n\nMake an effort to ensure all leads get an email covering a subject that is likely to feel valuable and useful to them. Scale back on the same mailshots sent to everyone and instead try to send better-targeted emails to different groups of leads. A short and concise email with a focused goal (such as offering your new free eBook on windsurfing) can still be effective if it is sent to leads with a particular interest in that subject. Other leads in your database (who are interested in speedboats) may find the same email to be spam.\n\nYou should also segment the email recipients by stage in the marketing funnel if you can. New leads, for example, should receive email offers on more educational and problem-solving content to increase trust and thought leadership. For leads that are further into the buyer's journey and more likely to buy your product or service soon, you might be better served by promoting comparative assets. This can be documents like buyer's guides, case studies, or discount offers.\n\n## Newsletter emails\n\nAs you have surely noticed, many companies send email newsletters with irrelevant or un-engaging content to poorly segmented lists. This only results in low open and click-through rates, and many unsubscribes. The result? A poor reputation score from the intended audience. Perhaps even worse, you can get a lower sender score that may affect your future email delivery success (we'll cover this in the next section).\n\nAn email newsletter is not a dedicated marketing message that promotes one event or one offer, a transactional delivery email, a reactive leads nurturing email, or a monthly round up of your latest blog articles. Rather, it is a general email containing a mix of company, product, or event news, educational content, or promotions. Additionally, newsletter emails are usually not sent to a focused segment of the leads database, but to all leads.\n\nWhile newsletter emails are one of the most common types of emails, they have a difficult time catching the reader's interest. This is because they have such unfocused content, and hence both open and click-through rates may be low. It may be difficult to reach success with general repetitive newsletter emails nowadays, but there are some advantages. One of the better ones is brand awareness and making sure customers don't forget about you.\n\nIf you decide you still want to run newsletter emails, try to make sure the majority of the message is of educational content, and only a small part is promotional.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nFrom the text, extract the email type used for generating sales.","chosen":"reactive leads nurturing email","rejected":"For each digital asset you offer behind a landing page form, design and set up the leads nurturing workflow that should be started when the form is submitted."}

It is important to understand what motivates different types of business to engage in inclusive business models.

{"prompt":"Consider this reference information delimited in \"\"\":\n\"\"\"\nDivergence vs. Convergence: An Overview\nThere are numerous trends and tools in the world of economics and finance. Some of them describe opposing forces, such as divergence and convergence. Divergence generally means two things are moving apart while convergence implies that two forces are moving together. In the world of economics, finance, and trading, divergence and convergence are terms used to describe the directional relationship of two trends, prices, or indicators. But as the general definitions imply, these two terms refer to how these relationships move. Divergence indicates that two trends move further away from each other while convergence indicates how they move closer together.\n\nDivergence occurs when the price of an asset and an indicator move away from each other.\nConvergence happens when the price of an asset and an indicator move toward each other.\nDivergence can be either positive or negative.\nConvergence occurs because an efficient market won't allow something to trade for two prices at the same time\nTechnical traders are more interested in divergence as a signal to trade while the absence of convergence is an opportunity for arbitrage.\n\nDivergence\nWhen the value of an asset, indicator, or index moves, the related asset, indicator, or index moves in the other direction. This is what is referred to as divergence. Divergence warns that the current price trend may be weakening, and in some cases may lead to the price changing direction.\n\nDivergence can be either positive or negative. For example, positive divergence occurs when a stock is nearing a low but its indicators start to rally. This would be a sign of trend reversal, potentially opening up an entry opportunity for the trader. On the other hand, negative divergence happens when prices go higher while the indicator signals a new low.\n\nWhen divergence does occur, it does not mean the price will reverse or that a reversal will occur soon. In fact, divergence can last a long time, so acting on it alone could mean substantial losses if the price does not react as expected. Traders generally don't exclusively rely on divergence in their trading activities. That's because it doesn't provide timely trade signals on its own. \n\n Technical analysis focuses on patterns of price movements, trading signals, and various other analytical signals to inform trades, as opposed to fundamental analysis, which tries to find an asset's intrinsic value.\n\nConvergence\nThe term convergence is the opposite of divergence. It is used to describe the phenomenon of the futures price and the cash price of the underlying commodity moving closer together over time. In most cases, traders refer to convergence as a way to describe the price action of a futures contract.\n\nTheoretically, convergence happens because an efficient market won't allow something to trade for two prices at the same time. The actual market value of a futures contract is lower than the contract price at issue because traders have to factor in the time value of the security. As the expiration date on the contract approaches, the premium on the time value shrinks, and the two prices converge.\n\nIf the prices did not converge, traders would take advantage of the price difference to make a quick profit. This would continue until prices converged. When prices don't converge, there is an opportunity for arbitrage. Arbitrage is when an asset is bought and sold at the same time, in different markets, to take advantage of a temporary price difference. This situation takes advantage of inefficiencies in the market.\n\nKey Differences\nTechnical traders are much more concerned with divergence than convergence, largely because convergence is assumed to occur in a normal market. Many technical indicators commonly use divergence as tools, primarily oscillators. They map out bands (both high and low ones) that occur between two extreme values. They then build trend indicators that flow within those boundaries.\n\nDivergence is a phenomenon that is commonly interpreted to mean that a trend is weak or potentially unsustainable. Traders who employ technical analysis as part of their trading strategies use divergence to read the underlying momentum of an asset.\n\nConvergence occurs when the price of an asset, indicator, or index moves in the same direction as a related asset, indicator, or index in technical analysis. For example, there is convergence when the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) shows gains at the same time that its accumulation\/distribution line is increasing.\n\"\"\"\n\nBased on the provided text, could you generate a brief guideline for a novice trader explaining the concepts of divergence and convergence in the context of trading, and how these concepts can be applied in technical analysis to make informed trading decisions?","chosen":"Yes, I can generate a brief guideline for a novice trader explaining the concepts of divergence and convergence in the context of trading.\n\nDivergence and convergence are important concepts in technical analysis that can help traders make informed trading decisions.

{"prompt":"The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nThe Seedhill Football Ground was a football stadium in Nelson, Lancashire. It was the home of current North West Counties League Division One side Nelson F.C. from 1905 until 1971. During their tenure at Seedhill, Nelson were members of the English Football League between 1921 and 1931.  Nelson's last game at Seedhill was a Lancashire Combination fixture on Sunday 28 March 1971 against local rivals, Clitheroe F.C. Local newspaper, the Nelson Leader, reported that a crowd of over a thousand gathered to see Clitheroe beaten by five goals to three in what was not only the last game but also the first Sunday game at the stadium. Nelson then moved to their current Victoria Park ground on Lomeshaye Holme for the start of the 1971\u201372 season. Seedhill football ground was demolished in 1980 to make way for the M65 motorway.\n\nThe ground was situated next to the Seedhill Cricket Ground, currently the home of Lancashire League cricket team Nelson Cricket Club. Most of the land, on which the ground stood, is still undeveloped and the perimeter red brick wall is still visible on the Cricket Ground and Victoria Park sides. The land is currently used for the annual travelling fun fair which previously used the recreation ground on the opposite side of Carr Road until that was built on in the 1980s. In April 2009, the football club announced plans to return to the Seedhill site although this is yet to happen.\n\nDuring the 1912\u201313 season, a two-storey brick-built pavilion was constructed at the town end of the ground which housed the changing rooms on the ground floor with the boardroom and an office on the upper floor. The pavilion had a centre gable and a balcony overlooking the pitch. On 2 August 1913, the Burnley Express newspaper reported that, according to Nelson's annual financial statement, the cost of building the pavilion was \u00a3649.19s.7d. On 7 November 1932, the pavilion came close to burning down when a fire broke out in the boardroom. No-one was in the building at the time however heat from the fire burst a water pipe which put the fire out.\n\nIn 1921, with the help of volunteers, the covered terrace on the cricket field side was completed and was able to accommodate 3,000 people. In the same year, a wall was built around the park end and on the Carr Road side of the ground at a cost of \u00a33,000. The cover over the cricket field side was blown down during a severe gale on the evening of 9 January 1936. The Burnley Express newspaper reported that the main gateway to the field on the Carr Road side was also blown down and damage was done to the fence on that side of the ground.\n\nAt the end of the 1922\u201323 Football League season, Nelson finished top of the Third Division North and were promoted to the Second Division, now known as the EFL Championship. Seedhill needed to be upgraded for the forthcoming season so, in 1923, a new wooden grandstand was built behind the existing stand on Carr Road. The new stand cost \u00a35,000 to build and was able to accommodate 2,000 people on wooden bench seating. The old stand was dismantled and sold to Barnoldswick Town F.C. leaving a standing area in front of the new stand. Seedhill now had a capacity of 20,000.\n\nWork started on the park end roof in September 1929 and was completed by November that year at a cost of \u00a3690 which was raised by the supporters' club. The cover provided accommodation for 5,000 people standing on a shallow-raked earth and cinder bank. This end of the ground became known as 'The Scratting Shed.' Concrete terracing was laid on the standing area in front of the main stand in June 1952. There was a spectator bank on each corner of the town end of the ground - the one nearest Carr Road had a wooden building at the top which was called the 'Alpine Bar'. The highest attendance at the stadium was 14,143 for the Third Division (North) match between Nelson and Bradford Park Avenue on 10 April 1926.\n \nThe stadium was also used for Speedway and Stock Car racing from 1967, promoted by Mike Parker Promotions. The corner of the ground between the main stand and the park end served as the pits area for both speedway and stock cars. The speedway team, Nelson Admirals, eventually moved to Odsal Stadium, Bradford in 1970, though the stock cars remained until the stadium was demolished. The site is currently undeveloped and accommodates the annual Nelson travelling fun fair. There is currently an all weather athletics track known as the Seedhill Athletics and Fitness Centre however this is on Surrey Road on the opposite side of the cricket field and has never been home to Nelson Football Club.\n\nWhat is the main topic of the text?\n- Football\n- Stadium\n- History\n- Nostalgia","chosen":"History","rejected":"Football"}
{"prompt":"Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nWhat Are Treefrogs?\nTreefrogs are small, shy amphibians that dwell in our forests and nearby wetland areas. While often difficult to see, their cheerful trills, chatters, and croaks remind us of their presence, sometimes even within our own neighborhoods. A curious and patient observer may find one of these small frogs clinging tightly to a tree branch, its color matching the bark so closely that, when motionless, it almost disappears. In fact, most treefrog species can change their body colors to match their surroundings. With the ability to flatten themselves closely to woody surfaces and hold tight with sticky toepads, treefrog are not only well-hidden from predators, but are skillful and successful hunters of gnats, mites, beetles, and other invertebrates. Within the forested ecosystems that they call home, including within the region\u2019s national parks and preserves, these small, tree-climbing amphibians benefit greatly when ecosystems are kept in balance. Understanding the threats and dangers faced by treefrogs helps the National Park Service manage their lands in ways that protect not only treefrogs, but the places where they thrive. How do scientists set up monitoring projects to do this difficult job?\n\nTreefrog Monitoring Projects\nDetermining how animal population numbers change over time helps researchers evaluate the health of habitats and their inhabitants. This knowledge is extremely valuable for making good management decisions about the lands that the National Park Service manages and protects. Setting up a project to collect population information takes careful planning, and treefrogs, with their sensitive skin and water-dependency, are good subjects for population studies. In this project, the bottomland hardwood forests of the Barataria Preserve (part of the Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve south of New Orleans, Louisiana) served as the focus for the amphibian monitoring program [1]. Data collection in the preserve began in 2011 and is still ongoing.\n\nScientists must sometimes get very creative to \u201ccatch\u201d the animals they want to study, and the simplest setups can often be the most effective. To observe treefrogs, the researchers came up with a very clever plan. They used small plastic pipes, which they hung in trees at roughly chest-level. Such pipes were ideal because they resemble other natural cavities, such as holes or crevices in trees. Treefrogs seeking shelter could enter and leave the pipes without harm (Figures 1A,B) and, as the pipes were very durable, they could be used year after year [2, 3].\n\nFigure 1 - Plastic pipes were hung from trees at the Barataria Preserve, and scientists checked them for the presence of treefrogs.\nFigure 1 - Plastic pipes were hung from trees at the Barataria Preserve, and scientists checked them for the presence of treefrogs.\n(A) A green treefrog peeking out of a short plastic pipe 5 cm in diameter. (B) A small squirrel treefrog within the same-sized plastic pipe. This frog has plenty of room to enter and leave the pipe. (C) A scientist checking a plastic pipe for treefrogs.\nThe research team started by hanging 52 pipes within one small area, which they checked every month to count the treefrogs inside (Figure 1C). Researchers also identified each species and recorded the air temperature and air moisture level, so a picture could be painted of the site\u2019s environmental conditions. This information could then be combined with data on recent weather events, like rainfall amounts, heat waves, cold snaps and windstorms, to help scientists better understand changes in treefrog populations over time.\n\nTreefrogs and Their Habits\nFour different treefrogs are commonly found in the plastic pipes in the Barataria Preserve (Figures 2A\u2013D): Cope\u2019s gray treefrog, bird-voiced treefrog, squirrel treefrog, and green treefrog. As well as sharing the woodland habitats, these treefrogs have many traits in common [4, 5]. Being nocturnal, they are all active at night, hunting for their insect prey sometimes high in trees, sometimes closer to the ground. During the spring and summer, the treefrogs move to nearby wetlands, bayous, and ponds to find mates and lay eggs, attaching the eggs to underwater vegetation. The eggs hatch into tadpoles that feed on algae and other similar aquatic plant matter until, after a number of weeks, these swimmers morph into small frogs that continue their life cycles on land like their parents.\n\nFigure 2 - Treefrog species at the Barataria Preserve.\nFigure 2 - Treefrog species at the Barataria Preserve.\n(A) Cope\u2019s gray treefrog; (B) bird-voiced treefrog; (C) squirrel treefrog; and (D) green treefrog.\nWhat the Scientists Discovered\nThere were two main objectives that the scientists wanted to explore. The first was to determine roughly how many treefrogs of each species lived or visited the bottomland hardwood forests, using the numbers of treefrogs they counted in the pipes as a representation of the frogs\u2019 abundance at the site. The second objective was to see how treefrog detections changed across the seasons and from 1 year to the next. Combining these numbers with the environmental data allowed the researchers to paint a picture of the cycles of treefrog presence over several years.\n\nThe earliest phase of the study emphasized treefrog identification and how much they used the pipes across seasons. The original 52 pipes were checked monthly between 2011 and 2017, to produce an average number of treefrogs per check for each species recorded (Figure 3A). Two interesting findings emerged. First, some species were found more often than others: squirrel treefrogs were the most often encountered species in those early years, and Cope\u2019s gray treefrogs were so scarce that they were not seen even once. Second, treefrogs used pipes less often during the summer than the winter. During one summer season, there were 2 months when not even one frog was counted!

{"prompt":"Act as if you are a manager of a busy retail shop. Write a short story of at least 250 words. Explain how overhead costs affect your business, what they are, and what you can do to keep them low.","chosen":"Overhead costs are a significant factor in the success of any retail business. They are the costs of running a business other than the cost of goods sold. They include expenses like rent, utilities, employee wages, and advertising. It is essential to keep these costs low to maximize profits.\n\nAs a manager, I am always looking for ways to reduce overhead costs. One way is to negotiate with suppliers and landlords to get the best prices. I also look for ways to increase efficiency in our operations, such as automating processes or reducing waste.\n\nAnother way to reduce overhead costs is to analyze our spending and identify areas where we can cut back. For example, we might reduce our advertising budget by focusing on social media campaigns that are more cost-effective. We might also look for ways to reduce our energy consumption, such as switching to energy-efficient lighting or implementing a recycling program.\n\nIn addition to reducing costs, it is also essential to increase revenue. This can be done by offering new products or services, expanding our customer base, or increasing our prices. However, it is crucial to ensure that we do not price ourselves out of the market or lose customers to competitors.\n\nOverall, keeping overhead costs low is a critical aspect of running a successful retail business. By reducing costs and increasing revenue, we can ensure that our business is sustainable and profitable in the long run.","rejected":"Hello"}
{"prompt":"Read this for context:\n<start of reference>\nAmong the People of the Book there is an upright community who recite the revelation of Allah during the night and fall prostrate before Him. They believe in Allah and the Last Day, enjoin what is right and forbid what is evil, and vie with one another in good works. They are of the righteous and whatever good they do, its reward will not be denied them. Allah knows those who fear [Him]. (Surah Al 'Imran, 113-115)\n\nIn conclusion, a person who thinks in the light of the verses of the Qur'an and fears Allah can in no way feel hostility towards Jews because of their religion or creed. The moral teachings of the Qur'an exclude all racism. For this reason, a Muslim who follows the Qur'an does not practice racism and does not despise people because they belong to a certain race. It is commanded in the Qur'an that, so long as they show no hostility to Islam or Muslims, an understanding and friendly attitude must be maintained toward other reli-gions. For this reason, a Muslim who follows the Qur'an should assume a compassionate and friendly manner towards people of different religions, and especially towards the People of the Book.\n\nA Muslim's view of Judaism and Holocaust must be based on these basic criteria. Some Jews may be subjected to criticism only because they have a racist attitude, shed blood in the name of zionism and subject other people to cruelty in compliance with the commands of the distorted Torah. A Muslim wishes to see an end to anti-Semitic racist movements and ideologies such as atheistic zionism that practice racism in the name of the Jews, and a peaceable world order established, in which every race and belief can live in peace and justice.\n\nMonasteries, Churches and Synagogues must be Respected\n\nA Muslim must respect and protect the holy places where the People of the Book worship Allah, and protect them. For Muslims, these places are precious because in these places, people, whether Jews or Christians, remember Allah. In the Qur'an, the places of worship of the People of the Book, such as monasteries, churches and synagogues, are mentioned as places of worship protected by Allah.\n\n...if Allah had not driven some people back by means of others, monasteries, churches, synagogues and mosques, where Allah's name is mentioned much, would have been pulled down and destroyed. Allah will certainly help those who help Him\u2014Allah is All-Strong, Almighty. (Surat al-Hajj, 40)\n\nAs a manifestation of his loyalty to Allah's commands, the Prophet Muhammad (saas) was most careful not to destroy the holy places of the People of the Book. Such destruction means, in the first place, opposing Allah's commands. This aside, it means preventing people who have faith in Allah worshipping Him. Indeed, the Prophet Muhammad (saas) promised the Christians, who were the other party to a peace agreement he made, that their churches would not be destroyed and that they would never be harmed. The tax (Jizya) agreements he made with Christians also guaranteed the safety of churches.\n\nThe first agreement made after the death of the Prophet (saas) that guaranteed the protection of the temples was a tax agreement Khalid bin al-Waleed signed with the leader of the city of Anat. Ibn Ishaq stated that those agreements made by Khalid bin al-Waleed were also approved by Abu Bakr and the three caliphs following him.16 This aside, Abu Bakr offered the same guarantees that had been offered to the people of Najran by the Prophet Muhammad (saas).\n\nThe Islamic societies that abided by Islamic morality after the death of the Prophet (saas) also paid special attention to this issue. Muslim leaders who adhered to the Qur'an and the Sunnah [the sayings and doings of the Prophet Muhammad (saas)] respected the places of worship of non-Muslims in conquered countries and showed great compassion to the clergy. Christians who lived under Muslim rule for centuries never rebelled for reli-gious reasons. This, there is no doubt, is the result of the just and loving attitudes of Muslim leaders in compliance with Qur'anic rules.\n\nPEACE IN SOCIETIES WHERE TRUE JUSTICE PREVAILS\n\nIn the previous sections, we mentioned the type of justice referred to in the Qur'an, the attitude of Muslims towards the People of the Book and the compassionate and just administration of the Prophet Muhammad (saas).\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nHow can justice create peace in society?","chosen":"When justice is applied equally to all members of society, it creates a sense of fairness and equity.

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nOld Goa (Konkani: Pornnem Goem, Adlem G\u00f5i, Goeam; ) is a historical city situated on the southern banks of the Mandovi River in the Ilhas (present-day Tiswadi) sub-district of North Goa in the Indian state of Goa.\n\nThe city was established by the Bijapur Sultanate in the 15th century, following the Portuguese conquest of Goa it served as capital of Portuguese Indian territories such as Bom Baim and Cochin, from the 16th century until its abandonment in the 18th century due to a plague. Before the plague under Portuguese rule, it is said to have been a city of nearly 200,000, whence the spice trade was carried out across the Portuguese East Indies. The remains of the city have been declared a World Heritage Site by the Unesco. Old Goa is approximately 10\u00a0kilometres east of the state capital Panjim ().\n\nEtymology\n\nThe name Old Goa was first used in the 1960s in the address of the Konkani monthly magazine, dedicated to spread the devotion of the Sacred Heart, Dor Mhoineachi Rotti, which was shifted to the Basilica of Bom Jesus in 1964. Postal letters were returned to the sender, as the name \"Old Goa\" was unknown then, according to then- and long-time editor of the monthly, the great Goan historian late Padre Moreno de Souza, SJ.\n\nThe village panchayat uses the name S\u00e9-Old Goa, while the post office and the Archaeological Survey of India use the name Velha Goa.\n\nThe place is known as Saibachem Goem (referring to St. Francis Xavier as saib, i.e., master), Pornnem Goem, Adlem Goem or just Goem in Konkani.\n\nVelha Goa should not be confused with another former Goan capital, Goa Velha, lying some villages away in the south. The names Vhoddlem Goem and Thorlem Goem refer to Goa Velha, while Goem, besides referring to Velha Goa\u2014i.e., Old Goa\u2014also refers to the whole state of Goa in some contexts (Old Goa).\n\nHistory\nThe city was founded in the 15th century as a port on the banks of the Mandovi river by the rulers of the Bijapur Sultanate. It was built to replace Govapuri, which lay a few kilometres to the south and had been used as a port by the Kadamba and Vijayanagar kings. Old Goa was the second capital after Bijapur of the rule of Adil Shahi Dynasty. It was surrounded by a moat and contained the shah's palace, mosques, and temples. The city was captured by the Portuguese and was under Portuguese rule from 1510 as the administrative seat of Portuguese India.\n\nThe viceroy's residence was transferred in 1759 to the future capital, Panjim (a village about 9 kilometres to its west). Few remnants, if any, of the pre-Portuguese period remain at Old Goa.\n\nDuring the mid-16th century, the Portuguese colony of Goa, especially Velha Goa, was the center of Christianisation in the East. The city was evangelized by all religious orders, since all of them had their headquarters there. The population was roughly 200,000 by 1543. Malaria and cholera epidemics ravaged the city in the 17th century and it was largely abandoned, only having a remaining population of 1,500 in 1775. It was then that the viceroy moved to Panjim. It continued to be the de jure capital of Goa until 1843, when the capital was shifted to Panjim (Ponnj\u00ea in Konkani, Nova Goa in Portuguese and Panaji in Hindi). The abandoned city came to be known as \"Velha Goa\" (in Portuguese, 'Old Goa'), to distinguish it from the new capital Nova Goa (Panjim) and probably also Goa Velha (also meaning \"Old Goa\"), which was the Portuguese name for the town on the old site of Govapuri.\n\nVelha Goa was incorporated into the Republic of India after its annexation in 1961, with the rest of Goa. It retains its religious significance in modern-day Goa, notably in its relations with Roman Catholicism. The Archbishop of Goa and Daman holds title as the Patriarch of the East Indies. Unlike the patriarchs and the major archbishops of the Eastern Catholic Churches, the Patriarch of the East Indies only enjoys honorary title and is fully subject to the Pope. He has a place in the Latin Church similar to the Patriarchs of Venice and Lisbon. This title was conferred upon the Archbishop of Goa as part of a settlement between the Holy See and the Portuguese government concerning the link between religious and political aspects of its territories.\n\nChurches of Old Goa\nOld Goa contains churches including the Se Cathedral (the seat of the Archbishop of Goa), the Church and Convent of St. Francis of Assisi, the Chapel of Our Lady of the Mount, the Church of St. Caetano and, notably, the Basilica of Bom Jesus which contains the relics of Saint Francis Xavier, who is celebrated every year on 3 December with novenas beginning on 24 November.\n\nGallery\n\nLocation\n\nSee also\n\nChurch of St. Anne, Talaulim\nFort Bassein\nGoa\nDamaon\nVelhas Conquistas\nPortuguese India\nCumbarjua\n\nNotes\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat is the cultural and religious significance of Old Goa and how has it shaped the history of India?","chosen":"Old Goa, a historical city in India, has played a significant role in shaping the culture and religious practices of the country.

The city was the center of Christianization in the East during the 16th century, and its influence extended to other parts of the Indian subcontinent. The presence of the Portuguese in Old Goa also had a significant impact on the region's economy, as the city became a center for trade and commerce. The city's decline in the 17th century also marked the decline of Portuguese influence in the region, leading to the eventual independence of India from colonial rule.

The pilot and a medical student died, while the copilot and four medical doctors were injured.\n\nAccident\n\nThe aircraft, property of the Superior School of Civil Aviation in Romania, took off at 13:35 from Aurel Vlaicu International Airport in Bucharest and was bound for Oradea International Airport, where it should have landed at 16:35. The flight was a humanitarian mission and was crewed by a 55-year-old with 16,000 hours flying experience) and a copilot. On board were a doctor from Fundeni Hospital, one from Elias Hospital, one from Saint Mary Hospital, another from a hospital in Beiu\u0219, and a student at the Military Medical School in Bucharest. The team were to collect organs from a donor for a transplant operation.\n\nThe accident happened in poor weather conditions and the crew was flying according to instrument flight rules. One of the passengers reported the crash at 16:16 in a telephone call to the 112 emergency service. The Inspectorate for Emergency Situations Alba, part of Romanian General Inspectorate for Emergency Situations and the team of  Cluj was assigned to the rescue operation. The rescue team had difficulty finding the crash site, they did not know the precise location and the area was covered in snow and thick fog. Because of the fog, the SMURD helicopter from Mure\u0219 could not be used. Over 70 firefighters and policemen from the counties of Cluj, Bihor, and Alba and approximately 200 locals took part in the search for the wreck.\n\nThe pilot and the student died and the copilot was in a critical state, three of the doctors had multiple bone fractures and one had no severe wounds. All injured were taken to the Emergency Hospital in Cluj (Spitalul Clinic Jude\u021bean de Urgen\u021b\u0103 Cluj) and were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAircraft\nThe aircraft involved was a Britten-Norman BN-2A-27 Islander, registration YR-BNP.\n\nSearch operations\nEmergency search and rescue services were delayed because they did not receive the proper coordinates of the crash site.\nThe ELT distress beacon operated correctly, but search and rescue services could not locate the beacon on the ground, on 121.5\u00a0MHz. Moscow Mission Control Centre said that they did not receive any signal from Romania on 406\u00a0MHz during the incident.\n\nServiciul de Telecomunica\u0163ii Speciale said that it could not precisely locate the crash site because it had not received GPS co-ordinates of Dr. Zamfir's phone from his mobile phone service provider, who provided only the cell, which stretched over an area of . Using its internal GPS reference, Dr. Zamfir's phone showed coordinates , at  North of the actual site of the crash .\n\nThe main controversy in this accident is why all methods used to locate the crash site failed, delaying the search and rescue teams.\n\nInvestigation\nThe Romanian Government announced the start of two investigations. The first would look at the accident and the second the procedures followed by the rescue teams, which reached the scene only several hours after the crash.\n\nIn a preliminary investigation report, the Center for Investigation and Analysis for Civil Aviation Security () (CIAS) said that the ELT distress beacon was type ARTEX C406-2. This beacon transmitting on frequencies 121.5\u00a0MHz, 243\u00a0MHz (now obsolete) and 406\u00a0MHz, using two different cables for antennas. The cable for 406\u00a0MHz antenna was not found at the crash scene, which explains why no signal received on 406\u00a0MHz.\n\nPolitical impact\nAs a direct result of the crash of flight RFT111 and the response to it, the head of the national emergency response department, IGSU, resigned. One day later, also as a result, the Interior Minister Radu Stroe resigned. A passenger on board had died of hypothermia after surviving the crash because of the long emergency response. This has led to an overhaul of the country's emergency response methods.\n\nIn response to an open letter, Gary Machado, Executive Director of European Emergency Number Association assigned blame for the situation on Neelie Kroes, who at the time of the incident had not enacted European-level regulation requiring provision of GPS co-ordinates in emergencies. The lack of provision of this critical information from the mobile company of the 112 caller to the emergency services was recognised as a major factor in the lethal delay in the rescue.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nPlease classify the text into one or more of the following categories:\n- Transportation\n- Disaster\n- Medical\n- Military","chosen":"Transportation","rejected":"Disaster"}
{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nHans Feodor von Milde (13 April 1821 \u2013 10 December 1899) was an Austrian operatic baritone and the husband of the  soprano Rosa von Milde (n\u00e9e Agthe). He sang for almost four decades at the court opera in Weimar where he particularly excelled in the works of Richard Wagner. For many years, Milde sang under the direction of Franz Liszt, notably creating the role of Telramund in the world premiere of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin under his baton. He sang in several other notable premieres, including singing the role of the High Priest in the first stage performance of Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns's Samson et Dalila in 1877.\n\nBiography\nVon Milde was born in Petronell, near Vienna, the son of an administrator for Prince Guszt\u00e1v Batthy\u00e1ny. He initially planned to study law in Vienna but ultimately ended up studying singing under Franz Hauser and later under the younger Manuel Garc\u00eda in Paris. In 1845, he began his opera career at the Weimar court opera where he remained as a member of the company for his entire career under a lifetime contract. He developed a friendship, both professionally and personally, with Franz Liszt who led the opera performances there from 1848-1858. He notably sang Telramund in the world premiere of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin in 1850 under Liszt's baton. He sang several other Wagner roles with Liszt, including the title role in Der fliegende Holl\u00e4nder, Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg, and Kurwenal in Tristan und Isolde.\n\nIn 1851, von Milde married the soprano Rosa Agthe, with whom he had shared the stage many times. They had two sons Franz von Milde (1855\u20131929) and  (1859\u20131927), both of whom became successful opera singers. In 1852 von Milde portrayed Fieramosca in the premiere of Liszt's revised version of Hector Berlioz\u2019s Benvenuto Cellini and his wife sang the role of Teresa. The couple also notably sang in the world premieres of Heinrich Dorn's Die Nibelungen on 22 January 1854, Franz Schubert's Alfonso und Estrella on  24 June 1854, Peter Cornelius's Der Barbier von Bagdad on 15 December 1858 and Cornelius's Der Cid in 1865. Hans also sang the High Priest in the first stage performance of Samson et Dalila, at Weimar (1877).\n\nBoth Hans and his wife retired from the opera stage in Weimar in 1884 and they both began working as singing teachers. Their son Franz published a biography about his parents (Ein ideales K\u00fcnstlerehepaar, Rosa und Feodor von Milde. Ihre Kunst und ihre Zeit) in 1918. Music historian Carlo Droste also wrote a book on the von Milde family (Die Familie von Milde) which was published in 1907.\n\"\"\"\nFrom the text provided, extract the vocal range that Hans Feodor von Milde was able to sing.","chosen":"Von Milde was able to sing in the baritone vocal range.","rejected":"B2 to A5"}
{"prompt":"What is the history of the cardboard box?

In ancient times, boxes made of bamboo or wood were used to store and transport goods. However, it was not until the mid-19th century that the first cardboard boxes were created. The first cardboard boxes were used in Europe, and they were made of corrugated fiberboard. These boxes were used to transport and ship delicate goods.\n\nIn the early 20th century, the use of cardboard boxes began to spread to the United States. The first corrugated boxes in the US were used to ship eggs. During World War II, the use of cardboard boxes increased significantly, as they were used to transport military supplies.\n\nAfter the war, the use of cardboard boxes continued to grow, and they became a staple in the packaging industry. In the 1950s, the first die-cut machine was invented, which allowed for the mass production of cardboard boxes. This innovation led to a boom in the use of cardboard boxes in the packaging industry.\n\nToday, cardboard boxes are used to package and transport a wide range of goods, from food to electronics. They are also used in a variety of other industries, including shipping, logistics, and even construction. The cardboard box has become an essential part of modern life, and its history is a testament to the versatility and durability of this simple yet effective packaging solution.","rejected":"The cardboard box has a long and interesting history.

Even with a small bike, all it takes is a small uphill slope to give you a workout. Unlike large Gold Wings and Harleys, as well as some electric bikes, most of us don't have a reverse gear to help.\n\nGallery: Michelin Motorcycle Reverse Patent Drawings\n\n3Photos\n\nMichelin's solution is quite simple. Rather than adding gears or electric motors to the transmission, it's a completely independent system. It attaches to the rear swingarm the same way as the mudguards and license plate holders of many modern motorcycles. It could even be integrated with these parts from the factory. Small electric motors press two or three rollers against the back tire, which then turns the back wheel. These rollers retract from the tire during normal riding. The system even has its own lithium-ion battery, which eliminates the need for big ugly wiring from the bike's main battery.\n\nBeing electric, this device could supply not only a reverse gear but also assistance with forward movement without using the main engine. The patent says the system would move the bike at one kilometer per hour (0.6 miles per hour), and on up to a ten percent slope. That's where the forward option could come in particularly handy.\n\nWhile not everyone would benefit from this option, it would make bikes so equipped more accessible to smaller or weaker riders. People who can only tip-toe a bike would then be able to safely move it without relying on their own foot power to do it. The only problem I see with this system is that many people remove the hardware that sticks out behind the back wheel because it looks ugly. That would remove the reverse system as well. I suppose riders who don't need it could still do it if the appearance is that important to them.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nCould you please provide a list of potential drawbacks to a motorcycle with a reverse system?","chosen":"Sure, here are some potential drawbacks to a motorcycle with a reverse system:\n\n1.

While the agency says that more details will be announced in June, we do know that the process will only be available for those who are beneficiaries of an approved I-130 petition. For those who are able to participate in the new program, the U.S. government will provide advance travel authorization to allow the individuals to enter the United States while they await their immigrant visas. If this process is widely available to beneficiaries of all categories of approved I-130 petitions from these countries, it will drastically cut down the wait times for entry to the U.S  For example, in the \u201cF4 category\u201d for siblings of adult U.S. citizens, the June 2023 Visa Bulletin provides that the government is currently processing immigrant visas for people with priority dates prior to April 8, 2007:\n\nUnder current law and agency policy, it may take decades for a visa petition for a sibling to lead to actual entry to the United States. But or nationals of Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, under this coming policy, it may be that they can enter the United States soon after the I-130 petition is approved and wait for their priority dates to become current from within the United States, cutting many years or even decades from their wait times for entry. This policy could also benefit adult sons and daughters of U.S. citizens (category F1), spouses and minor children of permanent residents (F2A), unmarried adult children of permanent residents (F2B), and married children of U.S. citizens (F4).\n\nAgain, only those with approved I-130 petitions will have the chance to benefit from this new policy. Because of this, it may be advantageous to file an I-130 petition now to get it processed, even before the new policy takes effect.\n\nTo be clear, the information we have on this new program is very limited, and there is no way to take advantage of the process yet. Those interested should be wary of any attorney or other individual promising that they can already take advantage of this program or that they know exactly how the program will work.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nBeyonc\u00e9 is known to give keen attention to the videos that accompany her music, and many of them remain iconic to date. Some with elaborate stories, some with a message, and all with legendary dance sequences, these Beyonc\u00e9 videos rule Youtube with hundreds of millions of views.\n\nBlending relatability with art is what Beyonc\u00e9 is known for, and one of her best singles, \"Irreplaceable,\" continues to be one of her most-watched videos. The breakup song about a woman who throws her partner out of her home for infidelity definitely rang a bell for the Beyhive and even casual listeners.\n\nThe video showcases visuals that match the song, where Beyonc\u00e9 sees her cheating partner at a gorgeous home and points out to him how replaceable he really was. The video was a typical Noughties one, replete with the singer performing with her band.\n\nThe collaboration that brought together two maestros of music, Queen Bey and Shakira's \"Beautiful Liar\" was an audible and visual treat for fans of both musicians. The abstract video had Beyonc\u00e9 and Shakira appearing from the mist, dancing among beautiful forests and in shallow water, making for gorgeous frames.\n\nThey looked amazingly similar as they showed off the dance moves they were renowned for, which is probably what makes this such a popular video. It isn't often that one sees Shakira and Beyonc\u00e9 in the same video, singing about a man they both loved but chose each other over him.\n\nOne of the most played Beyonc\u00e9 songs in movies and TV, \"Love On Top\" is one of her most joyful ditties about finding love and enjoying it's beautiful parts. She kept her video simple as her stunning vocal range took center stage, busting some dance moves along with a crew in a studio.\n\nWith minimal costume changes and a simpler choreography than her other videos, this video from her fourth album, aptly named 4, is as happy and fun as the song is. Fans keep returning to it for a dose of serotonin.\n\nThis female empowerment anthem is a regular in playlists to date, and is also considered a Beyonc\u00e9 song that would make for a great movie. The Mojave Desert became a post-apocalyptic war scene, where Bey and her troupe of strong women bested men with amazing dance moves and fierce dominance.\n\nThe production value of the video for \"Run The World (Girls)\" was immense, and the visuals were striking (think: Beyonc\u00e9 standing in couture with hyenas on a leash.) The singer's dance moves were impeccable, and she even invited the Mozambican group Tofo Tofo to help her and star in the video.\n\nA lead single from I Am... Sasha Fierce, \"If I Were A Boy\" was a heart-wrenching song about the unfairly different roles that men and women are expected to play in relationships, and the video furthered that idea by depicting the singer in the role of a man, and her partner acting as a woman is expected to.\n\nThe role reversal was a clever piece of thinking, and the video got a dramatic black-and-white treatment. As always, Beyonc\u00e9's vocals were evocative, and the reversal at the end of the video is a kicker that fans still love to see.\n<end of reference>\nTask:\nProvide a short, one-paragraph summary detailing Beyonce's three top-performing YouTube videos.","chosen":"Beyonce's three top-performing YouTube videos are \"Irreplaceable,\" \"Beautiful Liar\" (feat.

{"prompt":"Read this for context:\n<start of reference>\nThe synthesis of triphenylene-fused phosphole oxides has been achieved through two distinct C\u2013H functionalization reactions as key steps. The phosphole ring was constructed by a three-component coupling of 3-(methoxymethoxy)phenylzinc chloride, an alkyne, and dichlorophenylphosphine, involving the regioselective C\u2013H activation of the C2 position of the arylzinc intermediate via 1,4-cobalt migration. The resulting 7-hydroxybenzo[b]phosphole derivative was used for further \u03c0-extension through Suzuki\u2013Miyaura couplings and a Scholl reaction, the latter closing the triphenylene ring. The absorption and emission spectra of the thus-synthesized compounds illustrated their nature as hybrids of triphenylene and benzo[b]phosphole.\n\nThe phosphorus-containing five-membered ring, phosphole, has attracted significant attention as a structural motif in \u03c0-conjugated functional molecules. Its inherently unique electronic structure, along with opportunities to modify the phosphorus center and the periphery by substitution or ring fusion, have stimulated chemists to explore a structurally diverse range of phosphole derivatives with extended \u03c0-system. These included, in particular, those fused with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) for possible applications in organic electronics, bioimaging and sensing, and asymmetric catalysis.\n\n To name a few examples, Yamaguchi et al. described synthetic routes to novel phosphorus-containing ladder molecules and their application as fluorescence probes for biological imaging. Marionette extensively studied the synthesis of phosphahelicenes with linear fusion of the phosphole and the carbohelicene units, and their applications in asymmetric catalysis and organic light-emitting diodes. Recently, Saito et al. reported the synthesis of phosphorus-bridged triphenylenes, that is, triphosphasumanene trisulfides, and demonstrated their capability as a junction for single-molecule conductors.\n\nThe synthesis of PAH-fused phospholes typically requires efficient methods for the construction of the phosphole ring as well as for the \u03c0-extension\/fusion of the PAH moiety, which should be smoothly implemented into the overall synthetic planning. In this context, we have recently reported the synthesis of novel phosphahelicenes that featured angular fusion of the phosphole and the carbohelicene moieties. The approach focused on the regioselective one-pot synthesis of a 7-hydroxybenzo[b]phosphole derivative from an 3-alkoxyphenylzinc reagent, an alkyne, and dichlorophenylphosphine. The hydroxy group of this key intermediate served as a handle for the \u03c0-extension through a Suzuki\u2013Miyaura coupling, Sonogashira coupling, and electrophilic alkyne carbocyclization.\n\nGiven the successful synthesis of the angularly fused phosphahelicenes, we became interested in the further exploitation of 7-hydroxybenzo[b]phosphole as an intermediate for the synthesis of \u03c0-extended phospholes. In this respect, our attention focused on the fusion of phosphole with triphenylene, which represents one of the most common disc-like PAH motifs in organic materials chemistry. Herein, we report on the synthesis of triphenylene-fused phosphole oxides, which are distinct from Saito\u2019s compounds as well as from other reported examples in terms of the mode of fusion of the phosphole and triphenylene units. The present phosphole\/triphenylene hybrid molecules displayed absorption and emission profiles that reflected the characteristics of both triphenylene and benzo[b]phosphole.\n<end of reference>\nYour task is to:\nHighlight the main discoveries of triphenylene in simpler terms from the passage in this specific format:\n[Name of the person] \n[Empty space]\n [What they discovered \/ studied] -- [The results of the discovery \/ studied] \n[Empty space]\n[What it means making this discovery]\n\nI am not familiar with chemistry terms and I do not want to skim through the whole excerpt.","chosen":"Yamaguchi et al.\n\nStudied Phosphorus-containing ladder molecules and their application as fluorescence probes for biological imaging.\n\nMeans that the discovery of Phosphorus-containing ladder molecules had the potential to be used in bioimaging and sensing.","rejected":"Yamaguchi et al.\n________________________________________________________________________________________\n3-alkoxyphenylzinc chloride -- 7-hydroxybenzo[b]phosphole\n________________________________________________________________________________________\nIt means that 7-hydroxybenzo[b]phosphole is a unique molecule that can be used as a handle for the synthesis of other molecules."}
{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nSilence projects strength and authority.\n\nIt communicates better when you\u2019ve had enough of what\u2019s going on. When practicality fails to serve its purpose and words become like dried and trodden sand underfoot. Excuses lose their meaning and their validity.\n\nSilence brings about a sense of comfort. Sometimes you tend to say too much. You over-explain yourself, not knowing if it\u2019ll make any difference. When nothing makes you feel good and you\u2019re lost. Your mind is overcrowded with words bubbling over, demanding release. But you can\u2019t give expression to any, so you bolt the door. You stay silent in the black darkness, retreating inward, into the inner solitude of your mind where you find space to be you.\n\nSilence speaks volumes when they don\u2019t recognize, acknowledge, or refuse to understand. It\u2019s the loudest sound there is when words do not adequately express thoughts to deaf ears. It speaks through the hurt when it\u2019s too painful to talk. It lets them know they\u2019ve hurt you, not even sure if they are aware or even care. You no longer want to react, so you withdraw in silence.\n\nWhen you suffer, you do so in silence. When no one comprehends what you\u2019re going through and should never presume to understand.\n\nYou\u2019ve loved without boundaries, but they made you forget you\u2019re magic. When promises litter the air like fireworks, so colorful in their dazzling brilliance only to fizzle out and disappear in the darkness. What once sends a vibration to your soul now becomes fatigued and lifeless. All that remains within fades unresponsive into silence.\n\nSilence is necessary when you need to be strong. When you need to protect your brokenness from the all-encompassing truth. When you want to hide your weakness and conceal your wounds because they\u2019ll laugh at you or label you as crazy. You erect walls between them and you, finding ease and peace in being alone. You\u2019re at home with yourself, at home to heal.\n\nSilence permits your aloneness with your thoughts while you try hard to make sense of it all. Yet you know deep inside it\u2019s not about finding meaning as much as it\u2019s about finding acceptance. When the point isn\u2019t made clear and contexts get ignored, you begin to understand why desiring something that\u2019s largely out of your control causes so much pain.\n\nSilence is accepting, and that\u2019s not the same as liking or wanting. It\u2019s not endorsing or validating. It isn\u2019t approving or consenting. It\u2019s allowing. It\u2019s releasing resistance, permitting what needs to happen.\n\nSilence means you\u2019ve finally had enough. No more defending. You\u2019ve called it quits to crying and feeling broken. Enough of hoping for them to change, of talking and reasoning, knowing there\u2019s nothing more you can say or do. It\u2019s no longer your job to figure out why. You don\u2019t need to understand. You don\u2019t want to. You stop struggling and trying. You stop caring. You leave the pieces on the floor and turn away. You\u2019ve become indifferent to what\u2019s going on.\n\nSilence is when you finally see it as what it is. That communication has broken down, connections are lost, and excitement vanishes into thin air. Relationships become distant, slowly drifting off until the gulf becomes wider. You no longer cling on to hope, losing interest completely because there\u2019s nothing left in common.\n\nSilence is tough, but confronting the truth is tougher. You\u2019d rather avoid the argument than reason endlessly. Feelings get buried and happiness loses priority. Words become unnecessary.

In 1681, he succeeded his father as baronet.\n\nCareer\nCommanding a Protestant regiment, Beresford was attained by King James II of England in May 1689. However he was acquitted after the Glorious Revolution. He entered the Irish House of Commons in 1692, sitting for Londonderry County until 1699.\n\nFamily and death\nIn February 1687, he married Nichola Sophia Hamilton, youngest daughter of Hugh Hamilton, 1st Viscount of Glenawly,  who spent most of his career in the Swedish army, and his second wife Susanna Balfour,  and had by her four daughters and a son. His wife grew up with John Power, 2rd Earl of Tyrone and according to a family legend they both agreed in their childhood, that whoever should die at first, should try to return and report to the other about the afterlife. In October 1693, Nichola wore one morning a black ribbon and after a request by her husband, declared that her friend had died. Shortly thereafter a letter from the earl's steward arrived, confirming her assertion. She also predicted Beresford the birth of his son and when in 1713, a clergyman presented her documents, which changed her age to forty-seven, she announced her oncoming death. Nichola told a female friend, that in the night after the earl's death, his ghost had manifested and had given her information about her future life. As a proof, that it had been no dream, a black mark then appeared at her wrist, which she later covered with a ribbon. Following this explanation Nichola expired in the presence of her friend.\n\nBeresford himself died in 1701 and was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Marcus, later raised to the Peerage of Ireland by the title Earl of Tyrone. Nichola  remarried General Richard  Gorges  of Kilbrew, County Meath,  and  had a further  six children.  Despite the romantic family  legend, her death in 1713 was probably in childbirth with her youngest daughter Lucy, who  married  firstly William St Lawrence, 14th Baron Howth, by whom she had several children,  and secondly Nicholas Weldon. Her half-sister Jane  Beresford married the prominent  County Meath politician Gorges Lowther: their descendants still hold the  title Baron Crofton.

{"prompt":"Consider this reference information delimited in \"\"\":\n\"\"\"\nIn 10 years, Christopher Nolan's \u201cInception\u201d has established itself as the beginning of an era of film, from bombastic horn-filled scores to fantastical practical effects. \u201cInception\u201d explores the malleability of time, the untethering of reality, and the depravity of humanity \u2014 all while bridging the gap between mainstream blockbusters and art-house culture.\n\n\u201cInception\u201d\u2019s premise is that dreams can be constructed, manipulated, and shared, a concept which attracts professional \u201cextractors\u201d who work to exploit these dreams to steal ideas from, or plant them into, a subject\u2019s head. Extractor Dominic \u201cDom\u201d Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) assembles an elite team of six to infiltrate Robert Fischer\u2019s (Cillian Murphy) mind out of a promise from a wealthy client to clear Dom\u2019s criminal record and reunite him with his children. Dom\u2019s team stars a talented ensemble of Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne (Ellen Page), Eames (Tom Hardy), Yusuf (Dileep Rao), and Mr. Saito (Ken Watanabe). Dom\u2019s crew designs and populates an incredible three-layered dreamscape into Fischer's subconscious. With each level in this intricately designed heist, though, Nolan peels back a new layer of Dom\u2019s character, slowly revealing his deeply repressed guilt.\n\nThe concept of time is essential to understanding \u201cInception.\u201d Throughout the film, Dom and his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard) symbolically serve as figures of the past and future. Unable to change, Dom drowns in his guilt of the past. Dom desires to reunite with his children \u2014 to return to a time before Mal's suicide \u2014 so deeply that he endangers those closest to him. Dom finds it even harder to let go of Mal herself. In Paris, the projections of his own subconscious seize him and prevent him from retaliating against Mal. And at a critical juncture of the snowy fortress hospital scene, Dom prioritizes Mal's projection's life over completing the mission.\n\nOn the other hand, Mal lives in the future. Before her death, when she and Dom lived in limbo, trapped in a purgatory-like dream world, Mal only wanted to grow old with Dom. She literally locked away any vestiges tying her to the real world; for Mal, limbo had become reality. Her present children were no longer real, and her past lover was no longer real, either. Having lost all awareness of the present and the past, Mal embodies death itself. As the future always leads to death, Mal seeks her own demise and tries to drag Dom along with her.\n\nSymbolically, Dom's projection of Mal is also his rejected future; he pushes all his future wants and goals into the subconscious figure that is Mal. Neither half of him, alone, can live happily. As the film nears an end, however, Dom embraces Mal along with the forward-looking hope that she represented. He finally recognizes his real life with his children. Prior to this climactic coalescence, Dom treated and viewed every trouble with a tinge of irrelevance, since he saw nothing more important than his past. When he awakens on the plane of his new reality, though, his eyes bulge wide, receiving light and beauty that had been buried deep in his jaded soul. No longer does he rely on his memory of Mal to keep himself afloat. He doesn\u2019t need to check the top at the end, either. Because regardless of which dimension \u2014 dream or not \u2014 Dom ends up in, he keeps his eyes trained, and open, on the passing of his current life.\n\nIn a film about time, Nolan incorporates themes of time \u2014 dreams and memories \u2014into the structure of \u201cInception\u201d itself. On an initial watch, it's simply impossible to understand the full complexity of \u201cInception.\u201d Yet when scenes repeat themselves from beginning to end, the mystique is gone. And the specific moments are chopped-up and rearranged, like memory itself. It is only with astute attention that Nolan\u2019s thesis becomes clear: Be present, or the gift of life will be lost.\n\nImagine yourself in pandemic limbo: Do you look forward, or backward? It's easy to become Dom and let sentimentality overcome you and hang onto yesterday. It's also easy to live like Mal, waiting for the issues of today to pass. Yet it's the balance between these two extremes that we must seek. Listen to Saito, who aged decades in limbo:\n\n\u201cDo you want to take a leap of faith or become an old man filled with regret waiting to die alone?\u201d\n\"\"\"\n\nWhat is the author's objective in the article written?

{"prompt":"Refer to the information below to help with the following  delimited in ###:\n###\nCongresswoman Maxine Waters made headlines and raised eyebrows when the California Democrat showed up in the middle of a volatile crowd in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota in April. She called for agitators who'd already turned violent \"to stay in the streets\" and \"get more active, more confrontational\" ahead of a verdict in the trial of now-convicted former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. \"We are looking for a guilty verdict,\" Waters told media on the scene.\n\nAt the time, Katie reported on the hypocritical request Waters made for security on her jaunt to the North Star State:\n\nNew documents obtained by Townhall show Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters requested an armed police escort to Minneapolis over the weekend, where she called for violent activists to \"stay in the streets\" during a protest against law enforcement.\n\nWaters flew from Dulles International Airport to Minnesota-St. Paul International Airport on Saturday, April 17, just days ahead of a verdict in the George Floyd, Officer Derek Chauvin trial.\n\nThat night, Waters went to meet with protestors and demanded a guilty verdict for Chauvin \"or else.\"\n\nWhat we didn't know at the time was where the security personnel assigned to Waters came from and what her request meant for their usual duties. But now we do.\n\nWaters received protection from federal air marshals who were pulled from original assignments aboard commercial flights deemed \"high risk,\" a move that \"angered some sky marshals, as protecting the public is their primary mission,\" according to complaints and interviews reported by Fox News:\n\n\"Congresswoman Maxine Waters utilized numerous government resources inappropriately,\" the complaint reads. \"Federal Air Marshals were removed from a \"High Risk\" flight to cover Ms. Waters flight to Minnesota. The High Risk flight took off with no armed law enforcement on board leaving a gap in National Security.\"\n\nThe Federal Air Marshal Service falls under the TSA and the Department of Homeland Security and was expanded significantly by President George W. Bush to protect commercial flights following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nWaters\u2014who was reportedly already assigned a detail of two United States Capitol Police officers and two United States Secret Service officers\u2014requested two marshals for her flight from Dulles International Airport to Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport along with two more marshals to provide protection at the airport in Minnesota, a complaint to the House Ethics Committee alleges.\n\nRep. Waters is apparently not the only member to take advantage of air marshals following the events at the Capitol on January 6, and some \"who requested the service skipped their scheduled flights, according to records reviewed by Fox News, which was also told that lawmakers from both parties used the service \u2013 sometimes on official business, other times for personal travel.\"\n\nThe president of the Air Marshal National Council David Londo slammed Waters and other members of congress who use air marshals for travel protection in a complaint to the DHS Inspector General:\n\n\"Placing FAMs on aircraft simply because a member of Congress requests it is an egregious misuse of government resources. The FAMs are now taking agents off of regularly scheduled 'high risk' flights to put them on flights with members of Congress, that in most cases have their own armed federal security details onboard already. It has become akin to a type of extremely expensive concierge service for Congressional members.\"\n###\n\nWhat are the possible consequences of Rep. Waters' request for an armed police escort using air marshals who were meant to protect commercial flights?","chosen":"Maxine Waters' request for an armed police escort using air marshals who were meant to protect commercial flights has raised concerns about the misuse of government resources and the potential impact on national security. The removal of air marshals from \"high risk\" flights to provide security for Waters' flight has angered some sky marshals, who view protecting the public as their primary mission. The decision to provide air marshals for lawmakers' personal travel, including those who skipped their scheduled flights, has also been criticized as an \"extremely expensive concierge service.\" The practice could deplete the resources available to protect commercial flights, leaving them vulnerable to terrorist attacks. The decision also raises questions about the ethical and legal implications of using government resources for personal travel, especially in light of the January 6 Capitol riot.","rejected":"The request for an armed police escort by Rep. Maxine Waters using air marshals who were meant to protect commercial flights could potentially have serious consequences. First, it is an egregious misuse of government resources to place FAMs (Federal Air Marshals) on aircraft simply because a member of Congress requests it. This could result in a gap in national security, as the \"high-risk\" flights would be left without armed law enforcement on board. Additionally, it could anger sky marshals who are tasked with protecting the public as their primary mission. Furthermore, it could also be seen as a type of extremely expensive concierge service for congressional members, which is not an appropriate use of government funds."}

They both drove over to the theater and walked up to the ticket booth. While at the window, they scanned the times and discovered they had missed them all!\n\n**Chapter 6: Fact or Fiction?**\n\n\"Well, that sucks!\" stated Erinn. \"I really wanted to see _Grown Ups 2_!

I mean, I'm not going anywhere anytime soon.\"\n\nHe put his arm around her shoulders as she was texting Lisa, asking where she was and what she was getting into tonight, but of course, in the language of habitual texters, so it looked a little something like, \"Hey, where u at? Wut u doin 2nite?\"\n\nBefore she knew it, two hands covered her eyes and before she could jump, a familiar voice screamed out, \"Guess who, _bitch_!?\" And before she knew it, Lisa jumped in front of her, followed by about four friends. All of them started dapping each other, giving fancy handshakes, and for the girls, hugs and kisses on the cheek. They were all friends from the university, and if one would have ever thought of a group of college kids as mischievous and colorful, this would be the one.\n\nFirst, there was Darrell, who was always the leader of the group. He stood at six feet and was black and muscular, with an attractive face complimented by dark brown eyes. The black stud was wearing his pink, lime, and yellow Ice-Cream shoes and an orange hoodie and blue jeans. He majored in criminal justice, with a minor in psychology, which meant he had a few classes with Erinn and Lisa. Darrell also was in the same honor fraternity as Bryan, both of whom had been in the same pledge class two years prior.\n\nNext was Xavier, a whopping five feet nine inches of lankiness with brown shaggy hair and two ears that stuck out like a car with its doors open. Yet, he was as bright as they come. He had on his light yellow hoodie, green and blue-plaid long-sleeve shirt, white khaki pants, and white shoes. With straight A's and a 1397 on the SAT's, he majored in history with the hopes of one day teaching in a high school, although many wondered what would be the point of teaching in a place where students would just want to skip class, smoke \"funny things,\" and drink alcohol, with no interest in learning how our great nation came to be.\n\nThen there was Jasmine, a good friend of Lisa and Erinn. They had known each other about five years since she went to high school with the two of them. Jasmine used to be on the high school newspaper staff with Erinn, and they had fun trying to spice up the boring news about the cafeteria or some conspiracy about the students passing classes they should have failed.\n\nShe had a very pretty face with green eyes and brown hair that she had straightened and then put into a ponytail. Jasmine was wearing a purple and blue sweater with white diamonds, along with hip-hugging jeans and white tennis shoes. Her major was computer science and she had taken a few classes in hacking in hopes of finding a good job providing Internet security for some Fortune 500 company.\n\nLike Erinn, Lisa also majored in psychology. She was wearing black yoga pants and a double extra large grey hoodie. Normally, it was Lisa coming up with the crazy ideas about what to do. She was the \"suggestor\" of the group and when an idea was shot down, she was quick to recommend something else instead to ensure boredom never dawned on any weekend night.\n\nLast, but not least, there was Kyle. Kyle was \"that\" guy in the group whose job was to make everyone laugh \u2013 even if that meant making a fool of himself. He was wearing a grey and red Element hoodie, beige khakis, and red and silver D.C. skateboarding shoes. Kyle was a history major with a minor in anthropology, but also enjoyed everything paranormal, weird, and theory based. If it had to do with a legend, theory, or alien account, Kyle would be the one to investigate it.

Conclusion\n\nThere is no evidence to suggest weather was a factor in the mishap.\n\nChapter 2.6. HUMAN FACTORS ANALYSIS\n\na. Introduction\n\nThe board evaluated human factors relevant to the mishap using the analysis and classification system model established by the Department of Defense (DoD) Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) guide, Version 7.0, implemented by Air Force Instruction AFI 91-204, USAF Safety Investigations and Reports, dated 19 January 2018. Human factors describe how our interaction with tools, tasks, working environments, and other people influence human performance. The DoD created a model to engage in a systematic, multidimensional approach to error analysis and mishap prevention.\n\nThe framework is divided into four main categories: Organizational Influences, Supervision, Preconditions, and Acts. Each category is further divided into related human factor categories which are further divided into subcategories. The main categories allow for a complete analysis of all levels of human error and how they may interact together to contribute to a mishap. This framework allows for evaluation of any unsafe acts that are directly related to the mishap by considering the indirect preconditions, supervision, or organizational influences that may have led to the mishap.

[Sitting down.] We came to inquire for your dear mother, Gerald. I hope she is better?\n\nGerald. My mother has not come down yet, Lady Hunstanton.\n\nLady Hunstanton. Ah, I am afraid the heat was too much for her last night. I think there must have been thunder in the air. Or perhaps it was the music. Music makes one feel so romantic\u2014at least it always gets on one's nerves.\n\nMrs. Allonby. It's the same thing, nowadays.\n\nLady Hunstanton. I am so glad I don't know what you mean, dear.

Fresh natural flowers, books that don't shock one, pictures that one can look at without blushing.\n\nMrs. Allonby. But I like blushing.\n\nLady Hunstanton. Well, there is a good deal to be said for blushing, if one can do it at the proper moment. Poor dear Hunstanton used to tell me I didn't blush nearly often enough. But then he was so very particular. He wouldn't let me know any of his men friends, except those who were over seventy, like poor Lord Ashton: who afterwards, by the way, was brought into the Divorce Court. A most unfortunate case.\n\nMrs. Allonby. I delight in men over seventy. They always offer one the devotion of a lifetime. I think seventy an ideal age for a man.\n\nLady Hunstanton. She is quite incorrigible, Gerald, isn't she? By-the-by, Gerald, I hope your dear mother will come and see me more often now. You and Lord Illingworth start almost immediately, don't you?\n\nGerald. I have given up my intention of being Lord Illingworth's secretary.\n\nLady Hunstanton. Surely not, Gerald! It would be most unwise of you. What reason can you have?\n\nGerald.

{"prompt":"The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nIs a Brief Online Booklet Sufficient to Reduce Fear of Cancer Recurrence or Progression in Women With Ovarian Cancer?\nBackground: Fear of cancer recurrence or progression (FCR\/P) is a common challenge experienced by people living with and beyond cancer and is frequently endorsed as the highest unmet psychosocial need amongst survivors. This has prompted many cancer organizations to develop self-help resources for survivors to better manage these fears through psychoeducation, but little is known about whether they help reduce FCR\/P.\n\nMethod: We recruited 62 women with ovarian cancer. Women reported on their medical history and demographic characteristics and completed the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form (FoP-Q-SF). They then read a booklet on FCR specifically created for Ovarian Cancer Australia by two of the authors (ABS and PB). One week after reading the booklet, 50\/62 women (81%) completed the FoP-Q-SF and answered questions about their satisfaction with the booklet.\n\nResults: More than half of the women (35\/62; 56.5%) scored in the clinical range for FCR\/P at baseline. Of the completers, 93% said that they would recommend the booklet to other women. Satisfaction with the booklet was relatively high (75.3\/100) and more than two-thirds of women rated it as moderately helpful or better. However, FCR\/P did not change significantly over the week following reading the booklet [t(49) = 1.71, p = 0.09]. There was also no difference in change in FCR\/P between women in the clinical vs. non-clinical range on the FoP-Q. Women high in FCR\/P rated the booklet as less helpful in managing FCR\/P (r = \u22120.316, p = 0.03), but overall satisfaction with the booklet was not associated with degree of FCR\/P (r = \u22120.24, p = 0.10).\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that a simple online FCR booklet is acceptable to women with ovarian cancer and they are satisfied with the booklet, but, it was insufficient to change in FCR\/P levels. These results suggest that such resources are valued by women with ovarian cancer, but more potent interventions are necessary to reduce FCR in this population.\n\nExtract key findings and conclusions from the study on the effectiveness of a self-help booklet for managing fear of cancer recurrence and progression (FCR\/P) in women with ovarian cancer. Include the percentage of women with FCR\/P at baseline, their satisfaction with the booklet, and the impact of the booklet on FCR\/P levels after reading it.","chosen":"Over half of the women (35\/62; 56.5%) scored in the clinical range for FCR\/P at baseline.

Any engineer with a global perspective on sustainability should have an understanding of the systems in place to provide society with the elements without which life would be impossible.\n\nThis chapter will begin with outlining the trends in food production over the last century, how eating habits have changed and how agriculture has adapted to cater for this change in diet for an expanding population. In concurrence with previous chapters, we will then outline the environmental and social issues associated with current farming methods, finishing with suggestions for a sustainable food production system. Also included at the end of the chapter will be case studies of food growing projects that are successfully implementing sustainable practices in food production.\n\n## Trends in Agriculture and Associated Problems\n\nAs shown in Chapter 1, the biggest change in agriculture has been supplying food for an exponentially growing population. Primarily, this has resulted in a proportional increase in land use for agriculture. Although the production per acre has increased due to technological innovation (as will be discussed in the next section) the sheer volume of food required for a burgeoning population has put stresses on the land, and as discussed in the previous chapter, water. In many cases farmland has encroached onto natural habitats, destroying natural ecosystems. An example of this is parts of the Amazon being cut down to provide space for soya farms, which in turn feed cattle farms for the meat industry in the West.\n\nThe general paradigm in land use has been a shift from a large amount of small, family run farms dispersed evenly across the countryside, to a smaller amount of much bigger farms, employing fewer workers but achieving higher output through the use of large machinery such as tractors. This is evident in some parts of the USA, where there are colossal farms run by only a few workers. These large farms will invariably grow immense fields of one crop which can be farmed efficiently to increase output. This is known as monoculture farming and can lead to a loss in biological diversity and make crops more susceptible to disease.\n\nThere are growing concerns about whether the trends of increasing productivity per acre of land can continue while maintaining or restoring the natural resource base upon which agriculture depends.\n\"\"\"\n\nWrite a summary of this text in at least 5 sentences aimed at a general audience.","chosen":"Over the last century, food production has increased to supply an expanding population.

They had nothing to do with his apostleship. Peter and the eleven didn't send Paul out into the Gentile world, but rather the ascended Christ seated at the Father's right hand did.

{"prompt":"Background:\n<start of reference>\nTom Jans (February 9, 1948 \u2013 March 25, 1984) was an American folk singer-songwriter and guitarist from San Jose, California. He is perhaps best known for his song \"Loving Arms\" (also known as \"Lovin' Arms\"), which was recorded initially by Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge, and later by artists including Dobie Gray, Elvis Presley, Dixie Chicks, Natalie Cole, Olivia Newton-John, Petula Clark, Jon English, Livingston Taylor, Etta James, Millie Jackson, Jody Miller, The Beautiful South, Irma Thomas and The Cats.\n\nEarly life \nThe son of a farmer, Tom Jans was raised near San Jose. Jans's paternal grandmother had been involved in music, playing in the Rocky Mountain Five jazz group. His influences ranged from Hank Williams to flamenco (his mother was from Spain) to The Beatles. He studied English literature at the University of California at Davis, but rejected a graduate scholarship to Columbia University to seek a career in music.\n\nCareer \nPlaying coffeehouses in San Francisco, Jans met Joan Baez, who introduced him to her sister Mimi Fari\u00f1a in 1970. Fari\u00f1a had achieved cult status as part of a duo with her late husband Richard Fari\u00f1a. Fari\u00f1a had begun writing new songs and was looking for a partner to perform them with; Jans seemed to be a similar collaborator and the two formed a new duo. The duo played San Francisco Bay Area clubs and received notice from their performance at the Big Sur Folk Festival. The group then toured extensively as a supporting act for Cat Stevens and then James Taylor. They received a recording contract from A&amp;M Records, releasing the album Take Heart in 1971. However, the album received little notice and the duo split up in 1972.\n\nJans moved to Nashville to pursue work as a songwriter, working for the publishing house Irving\/Almo. His first hit as a writer was the song \"Loving Arms\", initially recorded by Kris Kristofferson and Rita Coolidge and then by Dobie Gray and Elvis Presley in 1973. Jans put the song on his self-titled solo debut album on A&amp;M Records in 1974. The album was produced by Mentor Williams and featured guitarists Lonnie Mack and Troy Seals. However, the record was a commercial failure and Jans opted to relocate to Los Angeles.\n\nAfter a period of isolation, Jans released a second album, The Eyes of An Only Child, on Columbia Records in 1975, executive produced by Lowell George. The album featured his song \"Out of Hand\", which later became a country hit for Gary Stewart. The song \"Struggle in Darkness\" was also a minor hit on FM radio, but the album was not a commercial success. His next album on Columbia Records, Dark Blonde (1976), also did not generate high sales, and Jans moved to Europe.\n\nWhen the Columbia releases failed to find an audience, his career lost momentum and although Jans continued to perform, he issued no recordings until 1982's Champion, a Don Grusin-produced album that was released in Japan only.\n\nDeath and legacy \nJans suffered serious injuries, especially to his kidneys, in a motorcycle accident in 1983. He died at age 36 of a suspected drug overdose in 1984. Mentor Williams's brother Paul sang \"Loving Arms\" at Jans's funeral.\n\nTom Waits dedicated a song to Jans, whom he and his wife had befriended, \"Whistle Down the Wind (For Tom Jans)\" from Bone Machine.

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nWhat would you ask for to God if you had a rapport with him? Well, we would ask for the power to forget a movie like God Tussi Great Ho.\n\nHave you ever wondered what it's like conversing with God? Would you wear white suits with pink accessories for your meeting with him? In the realm of God Tussi Great Ho, you would. This 2008 film marks the directorial debut of writer Rumi Jaffery, who, for some reason, thought that piling Salman Khan's shirts with more flowers than the Mughal Gardens would do the trick. If that's not enough, polka dots and frills are also tried on the actor.\n\nRumi seems to have come up with a crazy story overnight, imagined some scandalous and bizarre circumstances, roped in actors he believed would do justice to this flick, and hey, this potboiler is ready to be served. Okay, Rumi's work gets easier thanks to the presence of seasoned actors, but what else?\n\nGod Tussi Great Ho has an uncanny resemblance to Jim Carrey and Morgan Freeman's Hollywood flick, Bruce Almighty. Though Rumi denied it. Nevertheless, we were already prepared for some whacky stuff, because that's what Jim stands for, and we love him for that. But what God Tussi Great Ho lacked was a coherent plot.\n\nGod Tussi Great Ho traces the desperate attempts of Arun Prajapati (Salman Khan) to shed his loser tag. He's a TV host, like Jim's Bruce Nolan, who cannot earn his bread and butter. His bad luck always seems to follow him everywhere - he loses his job, fails to cement his relationship with his girlfriend (Priyanka Chopra) and on top of that, he has an angry father raving at his failures permanently. Who does he turn to in this dismal situation? His favourite punching bag God, blaming the Almighty for everything. One day, God (played by Amitabh Bachchan here, for who else would have done justice to Morgan Freeman's voice, right?) decides it's enough, hauls Arun to the moon and hands him all his Godly responsibility for 10 days, just so he may stop whining. God gives him divine powers and challenges him to run the universe.\n\nArun responds to his newfound powers with childlike zeal and just like that, his job is back, his rival defeated, the person he loves swinging in his arms, his father is speechless basically, he is having the time of his life. Until chaos begins.\n\nNow that you know the story, the result is a contrived, muddled masala movie meant only for die-hard fans of Salman Khan, whose overacting is up for laughs. Priyanka Chopra is merely a prop to add glamour to the screen, thrown here and there at odd times. There's a well-dressed Amitabh Bachchan looking like a model, who shows up as God for five to eight minutes and delivers a little lecture on how all of us sitting in the auditorium are bonded by fellow feeling. This God likes showing off his Godly powers, hence, make way for tacky VFX. We also have Rajesh Vivek, in the role of a beggar seen ordering food from Royal China. Slow claps.\n\nRumi indeed does quite a bit to change the proceedings of the film to fit the Indian constraints. He fuses in the family angle, the drama, marriage scene, fight sequences and the whole nine yard to entertain. Say, for example, the way the songs are picturised. In one song, we see fair-skin women dancing in sequined bra-tops and wings and in another, Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra are clad in wedding attire, lounging on a swing. Now, what is Bollywood without such song-and-dance sequences, right?\n\nThere's a scene in the movie where Salman's character invents a chair that acts as a lie detector to teach his rival Sohail Khan a lesson. Okay, we seen something like in Bruce Almighty too. But can we talk about the setting of the characters? The office environment and the attires used in a competitive TV newsroom is just weird. Trust us, we know this one.\n\nThe second half of the film is pretty tedious and quite predictable. The pre-climax and climax won't sweep you off your feet. There are just no surprises in store for you to keep you hooked. You know exactly what's in store and that's what bogs the film down.\n\nRemember we told you that Rumi denied God Tussi Great Ho is a remake. Wonder what he would say if we made him sit on that lie detector chair he created in his movie.\n\nIf you want to torture yourself, you can find God Tussi Great Ho on YouTube for free.

A giant? Jealous of the people in a city he could crush under his shoe? Hardly worth his time, I would think. But why am I talking as if the giant is real? There is no giant.

But...it is odd that you should say such a thing. I had a dream only a few nights ago of a great and powerful king. He told me someone was coming to take me out from under the shadow of the giant. Crevtonians do not generally put much stock in dreams and things like that. I only mention it because...because for half a moment I almost believed you.\" A wistful look came into his eyes. \"I would like very much to be free from the giant. And I have always wanted to see the sea.\"\n\nArtemerio shook the innkeeper's hand. \"It has been a pleasure to meet a fellow lover of the sea. I cannot tell you what the meaning of your dream might be, but I can assure you again, sir\u2014there is no giant.\"\n\nRoin chuckled. \"Quite the imagination.

The hood of her cape, which had entirely hidden her face at first, slipped slightly backward, and I caught a brief glimpse of her eyes.\n\nI paused in the doorway and watched her as she crossed the floor of the main room.\n\n\"Come along, Barto.

The one with the wild red hair?\"\n\n\"No. And I am sure I would recall that extraordinary nose. They seemed familiar to you? Perhaps it is the strangeness of this city playing tricks with your mind.

{"prompt":"given this background information delimited in \"\"\"\n\"\"\"\nBefore World War 2, the Auto Union brands produced various body styles for their cars. In addition to sedans, there were also open convertibles in various designs. Next to the number of seats, the number of doors and wheelbases also varied. Interestingly, it took a long time after the war before the successor company Audi found its way back to this body style. DKW managed this step relatively quick with the F89, F91 and F93 models, as did Auto Union itself with the 1000 SP. Audi didn\u2019t emerge from obscurity again until 1965, but initially only built sedans. The 60 and Super 90 were followed in 1968 by the first Audi 100. On the basis of that car Karmann developed a Cabriolet worth seeing. However, the Volkswagen Group\u2019s board of management at the time gave this vehicle no chance of going into production, which is why it remained a one-off. It would take until the mid-1980s before Audi would again consider a convertible.\n\nCABRIOLET DEBUTED IN 1991 ON THE B3 PLATFORM\nThe B3 series, better known to motorists as the third generation of the Audi 80, was chosen as the basis. This made its debut as a four-door hatchback in late summer 1986. Two years later, a two-door Coup\u00e9 appeared on the same platform, which was to outlive the B3, as the B4 (Type 8C) rolled off the production line from September 1991. This was available as a sedan and in the station wagon version Avant. The Coup\u00e9 already anticipated some visual features such as the new grille design in 1988, but retained the B3 platform until production ended in 1996. This also served as the basis for the Cabriolet from 1991. From the outset, this had a hood with integrated grille, which was only added to the Coup\u00e9 in a facelift. By dispensing with a fixed rollbar and placing the fabric soft top under a fixed cover behind the seats, the result is an attractive shape when the top is open. Closed, the Audi Cabriolet reveals a notchback with a large trunk lid and enough room for weekend luggage.\n\nSEVEN ENGINE VARIANTS INCLUDING A TURBODIESEL\nInitially, Audi relied entirely on a 2.3-liter inline five-cylinder engine with 98 kW\/133 hp. This remained in the range until mid-1994. At the same time, the range of powertrains was successively expanded. The first of these was a 128 kW\/174 hp V6 engine with a displacement of 2.8 liters in November 1992. This was followed in 1993 by a four-cylinder engine with 85 kW\/116 hp from a displacement of two liters and a 2.6-liter V6 with 110 kW\/150 hp. Two years later, not only the 2.0-16V engine with 103 kW\/140 hp was added to the range, but also a turbodiesel engine with 66 kW\/90 hp for the first time. Audi thus built the world\u2019s first series-production convertible with diesel drivetrain. The 1997 facelift, which gave the Cabriolet new bumpers, modified headlights with two projection lenses each and a rounder radiator grille, was the last time a new engine was used in the car, with the 1.8-liter (92 kW\/125 hp). Power was transmitted to the front wheels either by a five-speed manual gearbox or a four-speed automatic. A quattro all-wheel drive version was never produced in series.\n\nEND OF PRODUCTION IN 2000\nStarting with the 1997 model update, Audi moved production of the Cabriolet from Ingolstadt to Karmann in Rheine. At that time, sedans and Avants of the B5 series were already rolling off the production line for two years, bearing the model name A4 for the first time. The B3 platform in the Cabriolet thus lasted one and a half times as long as in the original Audi 80. Production finally ended in 2000. In the USA, the last units rolled into dealers\u2019 showrooms in 1998. There, the model series fell short of expectations, with only 5,445 units sold in five model years. A total of around 71,350 Cabriolets were built, of which several thousand are still on the roads of Europe.\n\"\"\"\nWhat was the evolution of the Cabriolet engine and drive chain over the years according to the provided text?

In 1997, a 1.8L 16-valve engine producing 103 kW\/140 hp was added. The diesel engine option was introduced in 1996 with a 2.5L inline five-cylinder turbodiesel engine producing 66 kW\/90 hp.

{"prompt":"The reference text below provides context for the following instruction:\nSeth tracked Camden first to the poorly defensible room where Camden spent the past moon cycle unknowingly watched over by Seth. Then, his blood growing cold and thick with each step, he followed those same faint tracks right into the heart of a city long since abandoned by all but the Ravineux and the single human in their midst, Seth. Worse yet, Camden seemed intent on traipsing straight into the most thickly Ravineux infested sector of the city as the sun began to slide down from her apex toward the horizon.\n\nSeth watched the waning light with a wary eye. While there was no doubt they would be trapped in the city's center for the night, he harbored a great deal of doubt whether he would be able to find a safe place for himself and Camden to spend the hours of darkness. The cluster of towering buildings he wound his way through held too many dark, hiding places, and already he could feel eyes trailing over him, could feel their hunger dividing him into rapidly disappearing sections of meat to be shared among their pack. Seth tightened his hold on the brutal shard of metal he'd inherited from his elder in the tribe as part of the completion of his training as a pleasure guide. The wickedly sharp bite of her jagged teeth had taught many of the Ravineux packs to fear and shun his small sector of the city, and he sent a fervent prayer out to the Mother that their learned fear of him would grant him time enough to find Camden and secure a defensible den for the evening.\n\nJust as Seth nearly gave up all hope of finding Camden before the sun set, a scuff in the dust just inside the door of an enormously tall building\u2014perhaps the tallest of all the ones around\u2014showed that Camden had gone in sometime after the light rain from earlier in the day. Seth's heart jumped into the ultra-fast, hummingbird beat again.\n\n\"Moonbeam, may the Mother protect us both.\"\n\nWith that last prayer, Seth drew in a deep, cleansing breath to clear his mind of all distractions. Slinging his bow over one shoulder and stowing the arrow he had carried in one hand in the quiver on his back, for neither would be of much use in the confines of the building, Seth pulled a second, knife from the double sheath at his waist. Then he made his way with cautious haste into the dark maw of the building that pointed like a single, jagged tooth toward the skies above.\n\nBehind him, in the near distance he could hear the yipping cries of a pack of Ravineux. The noise clawed at Seth's senses, pushing him to move faster, to run, and to barricade himself into the first defensible room he could find. He swallowed down the bile burning at the back of his throat. One of the first lessons a guide of his tribe learned was to master their own fears that they might better serve to guide others into the paths the Mother chose for each. To be a pleasure guide one had to know as much about fighting and growing as one did about the many ways of fucking. The Mother needed her children fed, and safe before they could enjoy the gift of pleasure, and any guide worth his or her guide's mark knew this. Seth's hand reached across his body, allowing the backs of his fingers to brush lightly across the bow, eye, seedling, and heart tattooed from shoulder to shoulder across his chest. The ink was nearly the same reddish brown color as his skin. Those who did not know the ways of the People intimately often mistook their tattoos for scars from fighting or birthmarks. Seth was comforted by their presence on the flesh below his collar bones like a nearly invisible shield for his spirit. Mother grant him cunning, speed and luck enough to find Camden before the Ravineux found them.\n\nThe walls of the building closed in around him as he followed Camden's tracks deeper into the structure. Shafts of light fell weakly through a few holes in the walls still, and Seth hurried forward. The dusty floors and lack of offal told Seth the Ravineux did not use this structure for shelter.\n\nWhat are some themes that emerge from this excerpt?","chosen":"This text excerpt is part of a novel that explores themes of survival, transformation, and the nature of power.

Six new US military bases have been established at strategic points and soldiers have been given police functions so they can take part in actions against the civilian population. The results have been catastrophic, and have included people being shot at close range, attacks on public transport with people wounded, and even the murder of young people, including a 15-year-old boy named Ebed Jasiel Yanez, killed by an army patrol in the east of the capital in 2011.\n\nThere has been heavy militarization of the Bajo Agu\u00e1n, an area where there is systematic repression of peasant farmers, and where major landowners occupy their land, which is state property. It is an issue that, if it is addressed by the corporate media at all, receives heavily-biased treatment, and a lot of information which would help resolve the problem is censored.\n\nIn 2012, various journalists covering news in the region were branded subversives and accused of undertaking a campaign to discredit the military.\n\nWhile farmers in the region have suffered censorship, journalists there have been severely persecuted.

{"prompt":"Reference:\n<start of reference>\nThe process of industrialization in the United States began to take off around the time of the Civil War. The rapid growth of the railroad across the nation, coupled with the increasing surpluses provided by mechanized agriculture, provided a base for the development of industry and the resultant rise of cities and the mass urban labor force. From around 1840 to the early 1950s, industry consistently grew as a portion of the American labor force, interrupted only by the Great Depression. To accommodate this industry, a wave of city building followed, adding growth to the old trading cities of the East such as Philadelphia and New York, and leading to the rise of new interior cities like Detroit, Chicago, and St. Louis. This process continued through the late 19th and early 20th centuries, stalling in the decade or so following the Second World War with the widespread growth of suburbs. City building in America has largely been in decline ever since.\n\nThe contours of the development of the US industrial base can be seen by tracing the development of the American machine tool industry. Machine tools are a good proxy for the overall robustness of an industrial ecosystem, as they form the base technical layer for much of heavy industry. In the United States, production of machine tools was scaled up during the Civil War, and by the 1880s high precision machine tools were being mass produced. Mass production continued to scale up through the Second World War, and technological innovation in the industry continued through the first decades of the Cold War\u2014but by the 1970s the industry in the U.S. was stagnant. Competitors in Germany, Japan and China dominated. For the purposes of this investigation, this developmental course can be read as a rough periodization of the rise and fall of American industrial capacity in general.\n\nThe United States became majority urban sometime between 1910 and 1920\u2014but American urbanization unfolded unevenly across space and time, generally spreading on the coattails of industry from the Northeast, then to the Midwest, then to the West, and finally to the South. Rail coverage followed this general pattern of spatial expansion, with mileage tripling between 1860 and 1880, and again between 1880 and 1920. The first states to become majority urban were Massachusetts and Rhode Island around 1850, and the Northeast as a whole became majority urban by 1880. Both the Midwest and the West became majority urban in the 1910s. As for the South, that region did not become majority urban until the 1950s, following its belated postwar industrialization (and the concomitant advent of air conditioning).\n\nIn American cities, flourishing industries provided masses of American workers with social mobility on a scale never before seen. After World War II, deals negotiated between labor and management institutionalized collective bargaining within the industrial sector, giving workers an unprecedented degree of economic security. Walter Reuther\u2019s Treaty of Detroit, negotiated in 1949 between the United Auto Workers union and General Motors, is a typical example of these arrangements. In exchange for protecting GM from annual strikes, it gave workers health coverage, retirement benefits, cost-of-living adjustments for wages, and guaranteed vacation time. For millions of Americans at this time, the American dream was in fact achievable.\n\nTo a large extent, this system of political economy subsidized many other parts of city life. It supported entire local business ecosystems, with small businesses catering to local workers. It supported a strong local tax base, which went to funding public infrastructure such as schools, parks, firefighting, and policing. And most importantly, it supported a dense and complex network of social capital, which allowed families, groups of friends, religious institutions, and voluntary institutions all to flourish and mediate community life. The industrial city was bustling and vibrant\u2014for example, in 1941, a streetcar ran every sixty seconds through the heart of Detroit.\n\nThis era is often romanticized, but its high level of social stability is indeed visible by certain measures: the homicide rate, for example, fell to its lowest-ever rate in the industrial era in 1935 as the system of political economy matured under New Deal reforms, and stayed there until the mid-1960s, when the dividends of deindustrialization started to come due en masse in America\u2019s cities.\n\nIndustrial capital also drove the physical development of America\u2019s cities to unforeseen heights, literally, financing the likes of the Chrysler Building even during the Great Depression. Every major U.S. city now has a cluster, sometimes a forest, of skyscrapers housing mostly service industries. Beyond cultural icons, though, the United States used its industrial surplus to invest in its infrastructure at the highest rate ever in its history, allowing cities to enjoy a well-functioning physical environment. In fact, America has not really built a city in this fashion since the beginning of deindustrialization. Newer cities such as Orlando or Las Vegas grew largely due to suburban sprawl\u2014not organized around urban life in any communal sense\u2014with large commuter populations who spend the vast majority of their lives outside of downtown.\n\nThe American urban landscape during peak industrialization, around the year 1950, reveals the context in which deindustrialization occurred. According to the 1950 Census, the top ten most populous cities in the U.S. at that time were, in order: New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Detroit, Baltimore, Cleveland, St. Louis, Washington D.C., and Boston. Since the previous census in 1940, all of these cities had registered consistent growth. The order of this list had shuffled around a bit in the intervening ten years, but its contents remained unchanged except for the replacement of Pittsburgh by Washington D.C., which had grown rapidly with the size of the federal government during the war.\n\nThis 1950 census is interesting as a snapshot of the American urban environment at its height, on the cusp of decline. Of these cities, all except Washington D.C. had grown on the back of industrialization. What\u2019s more, the population of each of these cities save for Los Angeles and New York peaked in this census and as of 2020 have never come close to their 1950s-era populations (New York for its part began a decades-long decline but eventually recovered its earlier numbers). In all of the cities that witnessed population decline besides Washington D.C., deindustrialization played a large part in this process.\n<end of reference>\nInstruction:\nWhat was negotiated in Walter Reuther's Treaty of Detroit in 1949?

{"prompt":"according to the following reference text delimited in ###\n###\nA bowl of Halloween candy is enough to frighten any healthy eater. After just one piece, it can feel impossible to stop\u2014until you get a stomachache. You might assume that sugar is the sole reason that Halloween candy is so hard to resist. After all, it can activate reward circuits in the brain that also light up in response to drugs like cocaine, and it is possible to build up a tolerance to and dependence on sugar. But Halloween candy\u2019s hold on you goes beyond sugar alone. \u201cYou can just keep unwrapping and popping those little suckers,\u201d says Rachele Pojednic, an assistant professor of nutrition at Simmons University. \u201cBut that wouldn\u2019t happen if you walked into an office and there was a bowl of white sugar on the table.\u201d It\u2019s the convergence of sugar, fat, and salt\u2014the trifecta of many candies, Halloween and otherwise\u2014that \u201creally revs up the hedonic eating system,\u201d Pojednic says, referring to the well-documented phenomenon of eating for pleasure rather than physical need. Studies have shown that sweet or fatty foods can activate pathways in the brain associated with pleasure and reward, kicking off processes that can compete with or override signals that regulate normal hunger and satiety, sometimes causing people to overeat out of pleasure, not hunger. And while salt, sugar, and fat are all tasty on their own, food scientists\u2014and food companies, as noted in a 2013 book aptly titled Salt Sugar Fat: How the Food Giants Hooked Us\u2014have long known they become irresistible when they come together. The hedonic effect may even transcend a candy bar\u2019s ingredients, Pojednic says. \u201cWe have these really complex neurologic systems where learning and memory and pleasure all come together,\u201d she explains. \u201cThat\u2019s why when you walk into the office and you see that Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup, your mouth literally starts watering. You will automatically start salivating, because you have this memory of pleasure, so that cycle sort of continues.\u201d Any palatable food can spur this effect, but something like Halloween candy, which is often linked to nostalgia and positive memories, is likely to trigger an even more intense reaction. \u201cWe\u2019ve all had experiences with food where there\u2019s this really wonderful memory around it, and we have this pleasure memory that goes along with it,\u201d Pojednic says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just pleasure from the taste or the smell of it, but also the situation that goes along with it.\u201d\n\nIt can be difficult to outsmart these bodily mechanisms, though some research suggests that consistently choosing healthful foods can eventually rewire your brain to prefer them. Until that happens, Pojednic says mindful eating is the best way to avoid an accidental candy binge. Next time you\u2019re faced with a mountain of bite-sized chocolate bars, slow down and take a minute to ask yourself, \u201c\u2018Do I actually want and need this?'\u201d Pojednic suggests. \u201cPartly it\u2019s recognizing that cue, which is so hard-wired.\u201d But don\u2019t beat yourself up if you do give in to temptation, Pojednic says. \u201cThere are moments and times when giving yourself a treat is a really fun and awesome idea, and there are other times when you have to have a little more mindfulness around why you\u2019re feeling the way you\u2019re feeling,\u201d Pojednic says. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be able to suppress those feelings. There\u2019s absolutely room for it in day-to-day life.\u201d\n###\nWhat factors beyong sugar contribute to feeling like Halloween candy has an irresistible nature and how can mindful eating help avoid overindulging? Each answer should be written in at least two complete sentences.","chosen":"Besides sugar, the combination of sugar, fat, and salt contributes to Halloween candy's irresistible nature. Its effect on the brain's pleasure center can override signals that regulate hunger and satiety, sometimes causing people to overeat. Mindful eating can help avoid overindulging by encouraging individuals to slow down and ask themselves if they actually want and need the candy, helping them recognize the cue and be more mindful of their eating habits.","rejected":"It's not just sugar, but the combination of sugar, fat, and salt that act together to create an irresistible urge to eat candy.

{"prompt":"The following information may be useful:\n<start of reference>\nAs an employer or manager, one of the most challenging tasks you may face is dealing with employee performance issues. While you may want to give your employees the benefit of the doubt and hope that they will improve, there may come a time when you need to take more formal action to address their behavior or performance. This is where writing up an employee comes in.\n\nWhile the idea of writing up an employee may sound harsh or punitive, it's actually a necessary step in maintaining a healthy and productive work environment. Documenting performance issues can help protect your company from legal issues, ensure that employees are held accountable for their actions, and provide a clear record of the steps taken to address the problem.\n\nWhether you're a new manager or have been managing employees for years, this post will provide valuable insights and tips for handling difficult situations in the workplace. By understanding the importance of writing up an employee and following best practices for doing so, you can help your team thrive, and your company succeed.\n\nEmployee write-ups typically include information such as the date of the incident, a description of the problem, the expected behavior or performance, and the consequences if the issue is not resolved. By documenting the issue in writing, the employer can ensure that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the situation, and can take appropriate action if necessary.\n\nIt's important to note that an employee write-up should be part of a larger disciplinary process that includes verbal warnings, coaching, and progressive discipline. It should not be the first step taken when addressing a performance issue, but rather a last resort when other attempts to correct the behavior have failed.\n\nWhen it comes to writing up an employee, it's essential to include all of the facts surrounding the issue in question. This includes documenting the date and time of the incident, any witnesses who were present, and a clear description of the behavior or performance problem.\n\nBy including all of the facts in the write-up form, you can create a clear and consistent record of the situation. This is important because it can help protect the employer if legal action is taken, and can also help ensure that the employee understands why the write-up is necessary.\n\nIt's also important to be specific when describing the behavior or performance problem. For example, instead of saying \"the employee was disrespectful,\" provide specific examples of the behavior that was observed, such as \"the employee raised their voice and interrupted a colleague during a team meeting.\"\n\nIncluding specific details in the write-up form can also help the employee understand what behavior or performance is expected of them going forward. For example, if the write-up includes a description of the expected behavior, such as \"the employee is expected to communicate respectfully with colleagues at all times,\" the employee will have a clear understanding of what they need to do to correct the problem.\n\nIn addition to documenting the facts, it's important to communicate clearly with the employee about the write-up. This includes discussing the issue in person and allowing the employee to respond to the allegations. It's also important to make sure the employee understands the consequences of not improving their behavior or performance.\n\nIn summary, writing down all of the facts of a write-up and including it on the write-up form is important for several reasons. It can protect the employer in legal situations, help ensure the employee understands why the write-up is necessary, provide specific examples of the expected behavior, and communicate the consequences of not improving. By following these best practices, employers can create a fair and consistent disciplinary process that benefits everyone involved.\n<end of reference>\nBased on that,\nUsing the given passage, how can a write-up help an employee change unwanted behavior?

{"prompt":"Reference:\nMedieval battle scenes in movies or television shows usually feature heavily armed warriors mounted on huge horses, thundering across the plains to attack their cowering and quivering enemies. While it is common knowledge that film producers will distort or exaggerate reality for dramatic effect, few would have suspected just how much this particular type of portrayal has been exaggerated. A new study on the medieval horse, i.e., medieval warhorses, has now brought this misconception to light.\nInterestingly, the distortions in this case don\u2019t have anything to do with how they portray the warriors or the warfare. The exaggeration comes on the equine side, as the medieval horses used in battles were nowhere near as large and intimidating as they are made out to be in popular culture. Real medieval horses were solid, sturdy, and durable animals that were bred for dependability. In fact, they weren\u2019t very tall or long at all. Believe it or not, the medieval horse was more or less the same size as modern ponies.\nThis surprising truth has now been clearly revealed, thanks to new research carried out by a team of archaeologists and historians from five British universities, who have just published the results of their study in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology .\nFierce Warriors on Smaller-Than-You-Think Medieval Horses\nThe actual research involved with this project was not complex and involved no additional fieldwork. Archaeological excavations at 171 sites across the United Kingdom have produced intact horse bones dating from the years 300 through 1650 AD, giving the archaeologists and historians involved in this new study a good-sized database from which to make comparisons.\nIn the movies and TV, the typical medieval warhorse might be as much as 17 or 18 hands high (the equivalent of 68 to 72 inches or 173 to 183 centimeters). But the evidence analyzed in the English study showed that horses in the Middle Ages were much shorter than this. Horses over 15 hands were \u201cvery rare indeed,\u201d say the researchers, and most were one or two hands less than this.\nMedieval horses were \"clearly much smaller than we might expect for equivalent functions today,\" University of Exeter archaeologist Alan Outram said, in a press release issued by his university. \u201cSelection and breeding practices in the Royal studs may have focused as much on temperament and the correct physical characteristics for warfare as they did on raw size.\"\nThe tallest horse from the Norman era (11th and 12th centuries) identified from the archaeological records was found at Trowbridge Castle in Wiltshire. This horse was only 15 hands high, which puts it on a par with small light riding horses in the present day. Only during the high medieval period (1200-1350 AD) did horses begin to reach the 16-hand mark, and that would remain the peak of horse size until they began to get bigger in the post-medieval period (after the year 1500).\nIt should be noted that medieval horse riders and trainers were not working exclusively with what nature provided. Knowledge of horse breeding practices was widespread, and significant investments of time and money were expended in the attempt to breed the perfect animals for warfare, tournaments, hunting, and other activities that required the use of horses. The characteristics of horses during that period emerged from sophisticated breeding practices, and if they were smaller than expected it\u2019s because greater size wouldn\u2019t have offered riders any advantage.\n\u201cHistoric records don\u2019t give the specific criteria which defined a warhorse,\u201d said Helene Benkert, a University of Exeter archaeologist. \u201cIt is much more likely that throughout the medieval period, at different times, different conformations of horses were desirable in response to changing battlefield tactics and cultural preferences.\u201d\nMedieval warriors thundering across the battlefield toward enemy lines may not have looked as imposing or intimidating as imagined by modern filmmakers. But those individuals would have been every bit as lethal and dangerous as such portrayals suggest, riding on horses that were carefully and precisely bred for optimal performance in real-world battlefield conditions.\nThe Medieval Warhorse in English Society and Culture\nHorses deployed in warfare during the Middle Ages would have been used differently than in the past. During this time mounted cavalries were transformed into more potent and deadly forces, in the form of heavily armed and armored European knights who arrived on horseback ready to fight any type of battle.\nTactics employed by these so-called heavy cavalry generally involved quick strikes backed by manpower advantages and the use of overwhelming force. This strategy was designed to put the enemy on their heels from the outset, forcing them to flee while creating disorganization and chaos in their ranks. Once the enemy forces had reorganized and begun to fight back, knights would usually dismount and engage them in hand-to-hand combat, presumably having the advantage because of enemy losses that occurred during the initial strike.\nThere were variations on this theme. But for the most part, medieval warhorses were required to carry heavier weights on their back than warhorses would have been the case in the past. Consequently, they would have been bred primarily for strength and endurance, more so than great size.\nRegardless of the height of the medieval horse, its importance during that time period cannot be overstated.\n\u201cThe warhorse is central to our understanding of medieval English society and culture, as both a symbol of status closely associated with the development of aristocratic identity and as a weapon of war famed for its mobility and shock value, changing the face of battle,\u201d explained University of Exeter archaeologist Oliver Creighton, the lead investigator of the new study.\nHorses were valuable and highly valued in medieval England, offering the only viable alternative to travel on foot. The horse became essential in warfare, and that reality took horse breeding in a direction that made sense for the times.\n\nInstruction:\nAccording to the reference, how did the breeding practices and changing battlefield tactics influence the size and characteristics of medieval warhorses, as revealed by the recent study?

The reason we don't see them upside down is because of something called gravity. It's what keeps us stuck to the ground and prevents us from floating off into space.

But I'm still not sure about this whole business of being upside down on the other side of the planet.\nPrecious: You're not alone there \u2013 lots of people have trouble wrapping their heads around that one!

We return to the moment that we have already attempted to describe when absolutely nothing existed, no space, no time, absolutely nothing.\n\nBut now let us with our imaginations try to feel that we exist and are able to transcend this nothingness until we voyage through nothingness to a something. A something that existed in another concept of life.\n\nLet us, with our minds attempt to approach this distant reality rather as if we were leaving our galaxy in a craft of some sort, traversing empty space to approach a different galaxy.\n\nThis analogy is quite apt, the main difference being that instead of crossing empty space between our galaxy and a far different one, we are crossing some barrier between two realities.\n\nNow, we feel obliged to try to describe, if we can, what we mean by two different realities.\n\nObviously, words and concepts do not exist accurately to describe leaving one reality and entering another so we can only use analogies in feeble attempts to describe what we mean.\n\nWe don't know if you have ever left a busy, bustling, modern city and traveled to a very \"primitive\" area like a jungle, a desert community or similar. The contrast can be quite astonishing as we leave so call civilization and find ourselves in an area where survival is all that matters.\n\nThis is not to imply that the people who live in these undeveloped areas are in anyway less intelligent than city dwellers. These people develop different skill sets and live by different rules.\n\nSo, as we leave our reality and approach a different reality, we would expect life to live by different skill sets and different aims and objectives to the reality that we just left behind.\n\nWe hope that you have clearly understood what we are saying. The galaxy, the multiverse in which all of us have lived in since it was all first created by God long, long ago, is just one of an endless creation of realities stretching back endlessly and, no doubt, stretching forward endlessly and we are attempting to describe \u2013 or will be \u2013 one totally detached from our reality and yet, we hope, sufficiently close in many ways that we can use language to explain what we see.\n\nFrom the text, extract information about the existence of God and his creation of multiple realities.

It is now rolling out a new shoppable app as well as inner-city store formats.\n\nIf the test proves successful, IKEA aims to roll the Tmall store out to more parts of China. But there are no plans currently to sell through third parties in other markets, said Jon Abrahamsson Ring, incoming CEO at brand owner Inter IKEA.\n\n\"In other markets there are other conditions. So we dont see this as a starting point for a full roll-out, or a full commitment to this type of channel,\" Abrahamsson Ring said.\n\nIKEA sees China as a key growth market. The store on Tmall will offer around 3,800 of IKEA's around 9,500 products as well as services available in its own sales channels, such as delivery and assembly.\n\nIKEA has 30 stores in China, around half of which have been closed since January due to the coronavirus outbreak that has locked down large parts of China, spurring a move to home delivery as people steer clear of shopping malls and as people in quarantine spend much more time at home.\n\nOncu said the outbreak had not influenced the timing of the Tmall launch.\n\nPublished on\nMarch 10, 2020\n\nSHARE\n\nCOMMENTS\n\nComments will be moderated by The Hindu Business Line\neditorial team.\n\nComments that are abusive, personal, incendiary or\nirrelevant cannot be published.\n\nPlease write complete sentences.
